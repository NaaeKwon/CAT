i believed the hype on this film.,2.0
confusing plot and poor camera work,2.0
the plot is hardly there and the acting wooden!,2.0
"predictable, slow and drawn out for psychopath killer",2.0

just wish it had been in a better movie!,2.0
"unfortunately, this dvd is an exercise in little else.",2.0
it isn't even slightly funny in the least.,2.0
i guess i'm not that superstitious.,2.0
the film is a comedy drama romance disguised as sex teen romp.,2.0

i just don't see what all the fuss was about.,2.0

alot of the videos skip and jump while playing.,2.0

that was one of the only good routines in here.,2.0
the ending was too corny for me and would not end soon enough.,2.0
there was nothing great about the cinematography in my opinion.,2.0
but it does nothing to build a good story.,2.0
this is one of the most predictable and severely predictable movies i have ever seen!,2.0
the script doesn't care either.,2.0
efforts to make hercules appear humble result in him being just boring.,2.0

not my type  of  movie,2.0
i did not connect the story and title well.,2.0

this one lacks punch and insight.,2.0
not the best introduction story.,2.0
this movie was not what i expected.,2.0
"and at times, the script was terrible as well as the dramatics.",2.0
not even up to the standards of a cheesy lifetime flick.,2.0

disappointing on a number of levels.,2.0
"in other words, this film deserves  only two stars.",2.0
i just wasn't expecting this.,2.0
and absolutely no attention is given to the relationship between mason and daisy.,2.0
i did not care for this movie.,2.0
two stars out of five.,2.0
it was all over the place with a really weak story line.,2.0
perhaps its because both of their characters are so badly written.,2.0
too long and slow.,2.0
i love b science fiction movies but this was a d movie.,2.0
casting was also less than optimal.,2.0
some funny parts but very weak movie,2.0

the neonazi topic begs serious content which this film lacks.,2.0
even though the mood picks up it just wasn't my cup of tea.,2.0

a forgettable film with a lame ending with a below average blu preservation.,2.0
cloying child actress as the daughter of van and liz annoying.,2.0
"because of this, the hobbit is painfully slow and repetitive.",2.0
but ya gotta try a lot harder.,2.0
"""the babysitters"" drowns in its own implausibility from the first moment.",2.0
at that point it's pretty much just bad acting and a slow pace.,2.0
"bad transfer, otherwise, ok story.",2.0
seemed very obtuse to me.,2.0
it feels like i've been cheated.,2.0
i didn't really care for it.,2.0

the plotting is weak.,2.0
"maybe it got better as it went on, but it wasn't worth finding out.",2.0

"but...for the price, the sound is awful.",2.0
the story is weak although there are lots of people shot.,2.0
it had far more potential.,2.0

"these actors, save for one or few, are so overrated, it's a sin.",2.0
"i was hoping for a good payoff, a satisfying conclusion, or a nifty twist.",2.0
it's sad when a real artist just cashes it in to live off his reputation.,2.0
"pretty actors, but boring, formulaic plot.",2.0
i can't recomend this at all,2.0
jokes were lame and plot was not well contrived.,2.0

the wolf is much too scary and scraggly for them.,2.0
there is nothing memorible about this film.,2.0
"the script is very ""talky"" and the talk is not interesting enough to sustain.",2.0

this was softcore porn acting without the nudity.,2.0
i wasn't very impressed over all.,2.0
the movie is not believable.,2.0
well to be honest at least that would be funny,2.0
a modern day shirleytemple imitation that falls flat.,2.0
maybe very young ones.,2.0
"this ""sequel"" did not have the intricate plot that taken did.",2.0
"very inconsistent character development, with changes just to suit the episode theme.",2.0
they wasted the wonderful actress jessica lange.,2.0
this season is seriously lacking.,2.0

"sadly, i was quite disappointed.",2.0
awful acting and comical script let down an otherwise good idea.,2.0
the characters are annoying and i started hoping they'd be killed ending my misery.,2.0

"it was full of gore, i'll give it that, but it was so typical.",2.0
"however, what bergman and proctor add to this is really lame.",2.0
and what really stood out is that this crew has no chemistry whatsoever.,2.0
this one is just a little to below par.,2.0

there really isn't too much to say about this movie.,2.0
"this movie has so much potential, but the acting and even the action was horrible.",2.0

it was only so so to me.,2.0
"that being said it was a bit on the boring side,slow moving.",2.0
i saw this on digital cable and by my surprise it was boring.,2.0
the result here is that there is no emotional feeling aroused in the viewer.,2.0

it barely qualifies as a mediocre movie.,2.0
missed its mark...not very entertaining.,2.0
"the acting was o.k., but the story reeked.",2.0
don't expect much from this.,2.0
the ending to this movie sucks too....,2.0
over the top acting by mason and an idiotic ending.,2.0
good sets and period costumes and that's about it.,2.0

there are also far too many long stretches where nothing happens.,2.0
my most positive comment is directed toward the camerawork.,2.0

pretty much a typical story with cardboard characters.,2.0
maybe the producers were using those grotesk movie clips for shock value.,2.0
a really slow startup.,2.0
"the acting, unlike the first two installments, is a bad mix.",2.0
some of the acting was pretty cheesey!,2.0
"for example, the costumes were ugly and the captain's in particular looked poorly cut.",2.0

"things just happen, without the enjoyable rollercoaster ride of tension and release.",2.0
the ending was simply ridiculous.,2.0

while there are a few moments of interest overall it fails.,2.0
so i'm kinda disappointed.,2.0
i don't really regret the rental but just barely.,2.0
the female lead is too old for four young men to fall in love with.,2.0

it wasn't necessary to the story.,2.0
didn't finish the movie.,2.0
first of all i don't like reading.,2.0

the story is slow moving and poorly written.,2.0
good cast with nothing to do,2.0
"it wasn't very good, and i am a big fan of the rock.",2.0

not that exciting of a story.,2.0
julian fellowed little chats at the beginning and end of each episode were ridiculous.,2.0
"hoping for the best, keeping my expectations low and wanting to really like this film.",2.0
it's a silly story and jennifer aniston added nothing to this film.,2.0
but i thought it was not good.,2.0
more like a weak lifetime movie.,2.0

just didn't work that well.,2.0
not a great way to spend your time.,2.0
"looked interesting enough, but was i sorry i bought this instead of renting it.",2.0
"goofy, disjointed story, not very well acted.",2.0

great acting but just not my type of movie.,2.0
some good actors for sure but the plot is very naive for a modern audience...,2.0
the movie is not helped by the annoying musical score.,2.0

"you can understand what is being said, but sound is annoying.",2.0
"however, this set is so darned dark all the time.",2.0
it was to dark and some it you could not make it out.,2.0

i like the concept of the dvd but it just doesn't work for my toddler.,2.0
i really like christ pratt but this was a dud.,2.0

i fell asleep during parts of the movie.,2.0
not a fan of this movie.,2.0
"the plot was interesting, but throughout the movie it was very predictable.",2.0

the film's story seemed just ridiculous.,2.0
i don't think i've ever been so disappointed in a pair of films before.,2.0

its really pretty inane.,2.0
left me with a bad feeling.,2.0
i barely made it to the end and my husband left the room.,2.0
"hackneyed plot, trite dialogue, predictable every step of the way.",2.0
i'll pass on the old milk maid ho too.,2.0
plot was weak and actors performed even weaker.,2.0
this movie did not amaze me even with lot of special effects in place.,2.0
"they are consistent, but this movie is hit and  mostly miss.",2.0
the acting is very wooden and the animals were poorly represented.,2.0
"i wanted to like this, but lost interest due to the way it was done.",2.0

slow and unmoving plot.,2.0
the last third of the movie was not playing properly.,2.0
i struggled getting through this one.,2.0
he was a hero of mine but this bored me to death.,2.0
"but as kid stories go, this is a pretty lame one.",2.0
to much bad language for me,2.0
"not horrible, but really not that good.",2.0
the bottomline about this film is that i didnt feel it.,2.0
i was actually bored with it!,2.0
"so anyway, if you want a very dull spy story, be my guest.",2.0
perhaps i was expecting too much.,2.0
this was a weird movie.,2.0
the reason is most likely that the script was written with moore in mind.,2.0
the music gets two stars.,2.0
too deep for me to stay interested.,2.0
"i wanted a comedy, but the acting made this more a tragedy.",2.0
"overall, a big disappointment.",2.0
it's just not that good.,2.0
beyond that the story just didn't get off the ground.,2.0
somehow it just doesn't elicit the same kind of belly laughs as in yesteryear.,2.0

i was expecting a period piece but it was rather like an mtv video.,2.0
i just couldn't get past the guy with two left feet.,2.0
"boring , too much cussing , not as funny as reported",2.0
i didn't care for it.,2.0
if you like brainless college movies you might enjoy this one.,2.0
just not what i expected.,2.0

i thought this was kind of a boring movie.,2.0
very slow moving with many scenes repeated.,2.0

the movie is pretty grim.,2.0

could have been a more interesting movie if it hadn't been so mixed up.,2.0
"as you could probably tell from the title, this is a pretty simplistic film.",2.0

"honestly with the quality of actors in this movie, i was hoping for better.",2.0
watch the sean connery version instead.,2.0
i did not like the movie as a whole.,2.0
maybe i am just too much in love with the original film version.,2.0
"plus, the cgi was not very good either.",2.0
"instead, it was plagued with superficiality.",2.0
the only good thing about it is the acting of colin firth and reese witherspoon.,2.0
the movie is garbage.. and only mildly entertaining just to see a bit of flash..,2.0
they all fall short of any truth.,2.0
not even close to harrowing enough.,2.0
this movie dragged on until the very end.,2.0

"plot gimmick, complete with dark evil badguy who wants to take over everything.",2.0
story was too silly.,2.0

seemed half the movie was over before they got captured.,2.0
plot line is unexciting and unbelievable.,2.0
very weird opening montages...,2.0

too cute by half.,2.0
too many bad effects.,2.0

some of the other performances are a bit dated or truncated.,3.0
"all in all, it was ""ok"".",3.0
movie has a few issues with voice syncing but not too bad.,3.0
improbable coincidences throughout but fun to watch,3.0
movies that are continually remade with new actors are not always that great.,3.0
"true, there isn't much to the story.",3.0

"it's allright, but again we've seen all this before.",3.0
"still, i was expecting it to be a lot funnier than it was.",3.0
not the worst for a star trek fan collective set but far from the best.,3.0
good for kids or people of little knowledge or depth.,3.0
it feels like two separate films and it doesn't gel that well.,3.0
it's predictable but worth watching.,3.0

"""kiss me deadly"" had few similarities with spillane's story about a gang of dope traffickers...",3.0
entertaining but not riveting by any stretch.,3.0

historical artifact rather than entertaining movie.,3.0
everything was good about the movie but it deviated greatly from what i expected.,3.0
nothing special about this production.,3.0
he got it in england so you can guess what it is.,3.0

the acting is ok to good.,3.0
"was focused on the patients own daily dramas, kind of like a reality tv show.",3.0

a little too long.,3.0
a nice movie that kept my attention but nothing really outstanding about it.,3.0
maybe a little too simple but may be good for beginners.,3.0
it's ok so far.,3.0
the music was great and the characters were somewhat believable.,3.0

it's not the worst movie i've seen.,3.0
interesting but kinda quirky.,3.0
i little different than the original story line.,3.0
"also make the movies much darker, without so much story and you've got a hit.",3.0
the color is not the best and the sound is okay.,3.0
i don't think i'd watch it again.,3.0
"not hilarious by any stretch, but enjoyable just the same.",3.0
it is at least worth buying if you love comic book history as well.,3.0
"slightly funny, slightly stupid and definitely violent.",3.0
not bad for this type of film.,3.0
"overall, another unnecessary sequel, but one that is at least watchable.",3.0
decent action but even the simple revenge plot is shaky.,3.0
"the sacketts was ok, at best.",3.0
a little too quiet at times.,3.0
"it was ok, not the worst movie but could have been better.",3.0
"it ends happily, so not very realistic.",3.0
predictable but sweet movie.,3.0
great to watch once but not so much to revisit.,3.0
that it is somewhat based on true events doesn't save it.,3.0
there's nothing special about this typical romance flick.,3.0
"""he's old, they get confused.",3.0
if i'm lucky is a very slight little black and white entry.,3.0
ok... just let me say the movie doesn't start off bad...,3.0
"definite moments of suspense, a few surprises.",3.0
"the picture is better, but this has nothing really in the way of extras.",3.0
"this movie is worth watching, but not necessarily memorable.",3.0

"well, texas is pretty big.",3.0

the basic story was excellent.,3.0
its okay if you like burt .,3.0
dancing was good though.,3.0
"overall, the movie was ok.",3.0
and really don't think it's that much different then the first two.,3.0
fun but not hilarious movie.,3.0
"the movie is ok, it has brief, very brief, glimpses of okish acting.",3.0
i watched one episode and decided to forego watching more due to the cost.,3.0
it wasn't confusing and always seemed to make sense to me.,3.0
otherwise it was cute and worth the price of a rental for the night.,3.0
"the first two movies are o.k., that third one not so great.",3.0
"just an average historical drama, with an added mix of witchcraft and unlikely dialog.",3.0
a bit disappointed with the movie.,3.0
"this movie, itself, had good acting.",3.0
"story was okay, but, very predictable.",3.0
i'm not sure how much of it is the truth though.,3.0
not as google as i thought it would be.,3.0
i also found the music repetitive and the music transitions to be grating.,3.0
basically this is a average movie version of an outer limits or twilight zone episode.,3.0
"the history is interesting, and, definitely has its' pluses, but, the title is mis leading.",3.0
"funny as always, but volume is too low.",3.0
probably best if it becomes available on amazon prime vs individual rental.,3.0
it turned out to be a love story.,3.0
i also noticed the pitched voices right away.,3.0
a streetcar named desire falls somewhere in between.,3.0
"mira sorvino is so stiff sometimes, she is less than unbelievable.",3.0
something to watch if you run out of worthwhile movies.,3.0
maybe when she is a bit older we will give it another try.,3.0
the plot reminds me of the wild wild west done with swords.,3.0
"was not as funny as the previews showed, but i watched it all anyway.",3.0
found his scenes distracting.,3.0
"""cygnus alpha"" is a bit hoky, with bizarre characters.",3.0
we enjoyed this movie but i'm glad i didn't spend money on this.,3.0
slow moving but still kept our interest.,3.0
"i don't mind suspending reality for a bit, but some of it was too much.",3.0
funny in some moments but it can be rather lame throughout most of the show.,3.0
"still an interesting site to see, but don't expect the same intensity.",3.0
collateral is not a bad flick.,3.0
not sure how she survived some of the fights.,3.0
"however,  the movie isn't how we remembered it.",3.0
the king of mystery could have developed a better story than this.,3.0
thus its okay and she is a very good actress,3.0
i'm trying to figure out how it survived at least five seasons.,3.0
the ending was terrable...,3.0

some were kind of painful to watch til end.,3.0
this happen to be an okay move.,3.0
"weird, but i did watch it straight way thru.",3.0
"it has a nice variety of stories, but don't use this to ""relax"" with.",3.0
that doesn't make the action less compelling.,3.0
worth watching for the cute shirtless guys.,3.0
i could have passed this movie by and not missed any greatness.,3.0
the movie was ok !,3.0
"some may call it a horror, but definitely not a usual kind of horror.",3.0
all i'll say about the movie is that it's alright.,3.0

i didn't see all of it yet.,3.0
slow start but gets better,3.0
"overall, this film looked like a decent book meeting the hollywood wall of myopic vision.",3.0

"a case of missed opportunities, but a watchable far if only for the visuals.",3.0
i did somewhat like the plot.,3.0
"the movies are still watchable, almost vhs quality.",3.0
not bad for kids though.,3.0

little be little the movie started to drag and get repetitive.,3.0
i liked the first one more however.,3.0
the story is rather weak.,3.0
"fair movie, sort of slow.",3.0
but if you like the saw movies you will probably like this movie.,3.0
entertaining but slow at times,3.0
i've always thought that kevin smith gets a bit too much credit for his films.,3.0
"it is worth watching and entertaining, but far from a great film.",3.0
three stars only because the sound was poor.,3.0

"it was just okay for me, it was watchable though.",3.0
ok... this is one of those movies i could have gone a lifetime without seeing.,3.0

"however, i thought the witches were very underwhelming and oz was merely adequate.",3.0
but doesn't quite succeed.,3.0
"it could be gorier and a little less goofy, but it is ok.",3.0
i was just disappointed with the ending of this.,3.0
she is an ok actress.,3.0

much historical background however somewhat glossed to present muhammad as a very reluctant warrior.,3.0
"it's not a bad movie, but a little cheesy.",3.0
action scenes are somewhat long and repetitive with chases and fights.,3.0
"in retrospect, this film is somewhat better than its reputation.",3.0
"drifts from the facts of the event a bit, way too many hallucinations by dicaprio.",3.0
somehow my expectation is far more than the reality.,3.0
fun but very dated.,3.0
if you need some action escapism to pass time you might give it a watch,3.0
though the concept was certainly amusing.,3.0
"it was okay, just another teenage movie",3.0
"the script is uneven, but it works more often than it dosen't",3.0
the terminator franchise should be terminated permanently now...its just gotten too convoluted plot wise.,3.0

it seemed the same as a hundred other movies with a similar pattern.,3.0
the plot was also pretty predictable.,3.0
lots of action with special effects and a weak storyline.,3.0
"there are some great,surreal moments and some truly awful ones .",3.0
jodie's character definitely did not miss her marriage.,3.0
we get plenty of small details as palin tries to do hemmingway type stuff.,3.0
though could have had more missions to set up final mission.,3.0
slightly better than the cheesy movies they play on syfy most saturday nights.,3.0

it all starts on soup day.,3.0
not the greatest ocean's movie.,3.0

enjoyed to story  line but at times it was difficult to keep my attention.,3.0
"barney miller's first two seasons were the weakest, especially the first.",3.0
there is not as much character development in this season.,3.0

not as good as the first mnovies but still funny enough.,3.0

there are better options available.,3.0
"on a more vapid note, johnny lee miller's lipstick really bothered me.",3.0
"so, icky title, great premise and actors capable of making it almost 'sweet romance'.",3.0
worth watching for laugh.,3.0
jack frost is an ok family movie.,3.0
it was not a very deep movie but it was entertaining.,3.0
"okay, this was one of those b movies...an add on at the flickers.",3.0
the story was fun for this type of movie.,3.0
"i'm not saying this is a bad movie, it's just very average.",3.0
i only give it three stars because it had a few magical moments.,3.0
it seemed chaotic and at times difficult to follow.,3.0
but the writers do a fairly good job of making it seem sort of fresh.,3.0
it's something i will watch once in awhile.,3.0
"this is not as exellent as the original, but it's not bad either.",3.0
fox does some good work.,3.0
some of the video seems a  out of place for the times.,3.0

the movies is basically okay.,3.0
"as it is, strike witches is ok but not great.",3.0
