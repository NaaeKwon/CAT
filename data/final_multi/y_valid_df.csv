every change to the order is an additional cost.,2.0
the fries were also disappointing since they were soggy and tasteless.,2.0
the would only give red sauce and if you wanted green it was extra.,2.0
i have to say this was just not a win for me.,2.0
there is a distinct lack of communication between both staff and customer.,2.0
"very noisy in the bathroom, luckily the noise wasn't as loud in the actual bedroom.",2.0
my son was struggling get any chocolate off the inside.,2.0
it had a weird sweet creamy flavor that absolutely shouldn't be in a cubano sandwich.,2.0
the loaded pizza was a soggy mess in the center.,2.0
"if you have, and you appreciate complex flavors, consider looking elsewhere.",2.0
"all in all, a wholly dissatisfying experience.",2.0
i've experienced way better.,2.0
"some sauce on the potatoes tasted spoiled, as did the yogurt sauce.",2.0
the problem is the food quality.,2.0
it was rather bland and lacked the gusto that the picture showed.,2.0
then when we were finally going.. we weren't racing.,2.0
"service is slow, and not always friendly.",2.0
when we ordered most of the sides were not available so our choices were limited.,2.0
"the wood chips are nice, they manage to outnumber the cigarette butts.",2.0
when it arrived it didn't even have what i wanted on it.,2.0
i ordered the chicken and spring roll vermicelli and it was less than delicious.,2.0
rickety table and horrible lighting accompanied our dingy back dining room.,2.0
too much milk added didn't taste no strawberry or anything.,2.0
use some of the money from raising the prices and fix the plumbing.,2.0
it's simply not fun anymore.,2.0
not so much anymore.,2.0
bleu cheese and seafood aren't a great pairing of flavors.,2.0
indifferent staff at the cash was unhelpful and bored.,2.0
"usually in a chinese joint, you hear the scraping of spatula against wok, but tonight....silence.",2.0
they need more than one gastonia location.,2.0
there wasn't much else to the tacos except cabbage.,2.0
i'm never a fan of this chain really.,2.0
i fave two stars because he offered a sorry.,2.0
this really sucks that i have to leave two stars because the food is awesome.,2.0
i've had much better cupcakes before.,2.0
i'll give it another shot in hopes they heed the reviews.,2.0
"the decor really blew me away, especially given what this place was before.",2.0
geared more for children but with that said very expensive for a family.,2.0
food was marginal....sunday brunch.,2.0
people weren't too pleasant either.,2.0
the drinks are super expensive too!,2.0
"whatever the cut of meat, it was tough and not seasoned well .",2.0
it was mediocre at best.,2.0
this place has potential.,2.0
adding to this is that they've made mistakes on our take out orders twice.,2.0
i realized afterward that they also overcharged me.,2.0
"otherwise, i'd look elsewhere in dormont.",2.0
i have been to better locations.,2.0
excuse was that they clean the car in the shade so they didn't see it.,2.0
i've definitely had better asian fusion for half their price.,2.0
"if it wasn't for our excellent waitress, i'd have given this place one star.",2.0
"well got sauce for breadsticks it was cold, bummer.",2.0
"overall, i think there's some value to barrio, but it's just not my thing.",2.0
"sorry, but was disappointed in this experience.",2.0
"after a healthy dollop of maple syrup, they were edible.",2.0
two stars are given in this review because the krispy kreme employee was very nice.,2.0
when it finally arrived it was cold.,2.0
the food just isn't good.,2.0
slow to get drinks.,2.0
order was screwed up.,2.0
"the service is fine, but that's not the reason why i'm writing this review.",2.0
"however, the service was lacking.",2.0
"i think this location needs... ""some rules, and try to get it right!""",2.0
don't think we would stay here again and certainly wouldn't recommend it.,2.0
lacking flavor and skimpy ingredients.,2.0
second i realised that our tap in the bathtub was broken.,2.0
sigh i should know better to just drive across town for good vietnamese food.,2.0
service was poor and food was alright and a little overpriced.,2.0
not the best option for me.,2.0
"some of the chips were chewy, not crispy, as if they had been undercooked.",2.0
kuma's product is very grainy and more equivalent to frozen yogurt.,2.0
this was not stellar.,2.0
"now, it isn't the coffee that gives it two stars.",2.0
expensive and not very good.,2.0
i don't think we'll be returning.,2.0
but the worst part of out stay was the smoke in our room.,2.0
overall we just spent way too much time waiting...,2.0
i had a fairly simple design for him and he messed it up.,2.0
i don't understand what all the fuss is about.,2.0
descent stay..don't expect luxuries here!,2.0
this place used to be amazing.,2.0
"wasn't great, didn't suck.",2.0
"the barista was nice, that earned the second star.",2.0
but the people working it doesn't make people want to come back.,2.0
"our waitress, melissa, was rude and not attentive.",2.0
the staff at desert cove is overwhelmed and understaffed.,2.0
i've ordered the pasta and salad and both were sort of slimy.,2.0
the fish seemed safe to eat but not super fresh looking.,2.0
but honestly the red lobster cooked better seafood.,2.0
the crab rangoon had several shells in it.,2.0
but really if they want to do better.. focus on the food.,2.0
the pot roast was dry.,2.0
this branch needs more help.,2.0
this is just a touristy place with average food.,2.0
we ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza and it sucked.,2.0
"our waitress was great, but the food took forever to come out.",2.0
however the food was bland.,2.0
"the breakfast buffet was way overpriced for the basic pancake, toast and egg display.",2.0
"this hotel was okay, but the shape of the building is what makes it terrible.",2.0
maybe that's why we didn't have a great time there.,2.0
it's highly unlikely i'll be coming here again..,2.0
was not impressed with this buffet.,2.0
i doubt the upkeep of robes for your customers is putting you in the red.,2.0
portions of food were small.,2.0
"however, prices are ridiculous.",2.0
my husband wasn't impressed with the beer selection either.,2.0
my problem is with the service.,2.0
we were bombarded by wait staff asking us the same thing.,2.0
"my partner had something with shrimp in it, and he commented that they tasted ""off"".",2.0
i had the chicken noodle soup which was mediocre at best.,2.0
the cocktails are extremely expensive for what they are.,2.0
"we had a variety of dishes for brunch, none of which were much better.",2.0
not the best experience for a first time customer.,2.0
the chips and salsa were o.k.,2.0
out of a lot of items on the menu.,2.0
i've definitely had a more flavorful chimichanga at a cheaper price elsewhere.,2.0
the pasta was very heavy and the chicken was kind of dry and lacked flavour.,2.0
expect the cheap version of much of your meal.,2.0
"spanakopita was ok, but i sensed a lack of ingredients in it.",2.0
was not a pleasant experience and very weird energy.,2.0
really deterred me from coming back which is sad because i enjoy njc.,2.0
we must've gotten an old batch because is was both dry and soggy.,2.0
the food is mediocre.,2.0
not sure about the answer to that.,2.0
"if you want to sit, i wouldn't recommend it.",2.0
overall i do not enjoy the people at shooters or the music.,2.0
there is honestly not a single dish we would come back for.,2.0
will not come again probably,2.0
nice atmosphere and décor but man is this place expensive!,2.0
vera herself seems very sweet...but her consultants are lacking in charm and grace.,2.0
much of the seafood was over cooked.,2.0
the interactions i had with the main contact person were disorganized.,2.0
this is a mediocre greek place.,2.0
the noshery downstairs in the hilton lobby has better beers.,2.0
"um no, small patty to many tomato that made it appear bigger blah!",2.0
the prices are high.,2.0
so my husband and i tryed this place tonight and i wasn't impressed.,2.0
he neither liked it nor disliked it.,2.0
noticed canoli tray filled with pastry.,2.0
service is not the best.,2.0
the reason why it was heavy is because there was mostly celery.,2.0
the food fell waaaaay short.,2.0
i used to live around the corner and frequented there.,2.0
it was overpriced as well.,2.0
"there were only about six ravioli on the plate, and they were swimming in sauce.",2.0
for the price i will go elsewhere next time.,2.0
"sorry folks, i think they believed the hype and forgot the execution.",2.0
the shrimp was really overcooked and mushy.,2.0
pricing scheme was way too complex.,2.0
so i didn't know where the sushi hotspots were.,2.0
the space is nicely done.. but the food just wasn't very good.,2.0
"charlotte's scooter monopoly, such a buzzkill.",2.0
then it was like the staff was rushing us to make an order.,2.0
charging for salsa refills is ridicules.,2.0
the staff wasn't so sure about the billing.,2.0
after eating our entrees we were both not feeling well.,2.0
order drinks not food.,2.0
i really wanted to like this place.,2.0
lacked flavor and was really bland.,2.0
"typical, overpriced, pretentious downtown toronto resto.",2.0
for my first visit i was not that impressed.,2.0
"nourriture fade, sans sel, sans poivre, sans herbes, sans épices, sans huile d'olive.",2.0
"i requested it to be toasted, it was not.",2.0
"if i had known about it, i would have gone to a different hotel.",2.0
my boyfriend ordered chicken fried steak but there was barely any steak.,2.0
okay first of all they have terrible sales!,2.0
it wasn't good at all.,2.0
"but, again, comparatively speaking, airport food is never good.",2.0
food not outstanding enough for me to return.,2.0
"i ordered the dark mexican draft beer, which was served way too warm.",2.0
it was so expensive and so not worth it.,2.0
"they also don't have vietnamese coffee, which was a bummer.",2.0
calamari was probably the worst i've had.,2.0
the fried noodles seemed stale and the vegetables were not well cooked.,2.0
but i'm not rushing back to try them.,2.0
"party of two, they gave us one menu.",2.0
"their sales are good, but everything else will have you emptying your pockets.",2.0
below average the duck was cooked here yesterday or the day prior.,2.0
"there wasn't anyone else in line to order, but service was still really slow.",2.0
but not at walmart tires and lube plus in urbana.,2.0
they had a bad aftertaste and seemed to have more breading then chicken.,2.0
far too many better breakfast options to recommend this one.,2.0
the packing could have been better.,2.0
i will give a second try unless i receive the same server,2.0
we don't expect this quality just because its a take out.,2.0
i've just had a whole lot better.,2.0
the service was so slow.,2.0
thought that would be a better way to do this.,2.0
"in our opinion, the items were overpriced for the quality and quantity provided.",2.0
the rings were very greasy.,2.0
"drinks were outrageously expensive, the venue itself was not that great.",2.0
good service but food barely edible.,2.0
but i let that go and didn't pay much mind.,2.0
be warned that the ground beef tacos aren't very good.,2.0
the food was meh.,2.0
"i ordered the all american burger with bacon, and it was marginal..  no flavor.",2.0
"offers call ahead ordering, but nobody answers the phone.",2.0
overpriced you definitely pay for all the tvs in there.,2.0
"furthermore, they were all dry.",2.0
it didn't help that it was late and we were very hungry.,2.0
however i had to spend some time picking out the gross fatty pieces.,2.0
unfortunately the sauces lacked flavor as well.,2.0
"also, everyone had a mild stomach ache after and the next day.",2.0
they have good spring rolls thus the two stars.,2.0
"the mini burger appetizer was served burned and hard, it was sooooo dry!",2.0
the service is good but the food is mediocre.,2.0
we both didn't care for it.,2.0
i'm willing to concede that this may be irregular for an otherwise good establishment.,2.0
and the place wasn't even busy for friday.,2.0
i thought it was pricey for the product.,2.0
"chicken and steak taste exactly the same, and lacking any heat whatsoever...it even lacked salt.",2.0
"in a word, meh.",2.0
not sure if i will be back,2.0
i usually go to the cheyenne location but the groomer wasnt available.,2.0
i honestly don't know if this is the  shasta pools in mesa.,2.0
it was way over fried.,2.0
food is salty and overpriced.,2.0
i had to downgrade my rating after last night's delivery.,2.0
plus it was way too expensive.,2.0
a bit stale looking with high prices.,2.0
i'm really not sure what happened to this place.,2.0
and the more forgiving shirts are too pricey.,2.0
the salad was an overly dressed soup of romaine and iceberg lettuce.,2.0
neither were hot through to the center of the dishes.,2.0
"sloppy nails, definitely won't be coming back.",2.0
they also make you feel like they don't like you.,2.0
"portions are tiny for what you're paying, food very average.",2.0
i've done better looking for jobs on my own.,2.0
they seem to skimp on ingredients and give extra on the attitude.,2.0
"in short, no more than an average experience.",2.0
the sushi station is pretty much worthless.,2.0
i dont know if they use cheaper quality polish or less coats.,2.0
there is no beer on tap and service takes a long time.,2.0
it tasted cheap and like it had been sitting there for a very long time.,2.0
than at the end they count more people that present and higher price than agreed.,2.0
unfortunately the last two or three times it has been disappointing.,2.0
the only plus was the service.,2.0
ac was broken so was very hot inside.,2.0
the food is ok but not worth the hassle.,2.0
"i ordered baked ravioli, unfortunately it was mediocre at best.",2.0
seemed a little cheesy to me.,2.0
the cheese tots suck.,2.0
music from the bar so loud that the servers can't hear the customers.,2.0
it's just not the same.,2.0
"even after two big gobletfuls, i wasn't the slightest bit tipsy.",2.0
also wine selection in very poor.,2.0
service is so slow.,2.0
"a little pricey, small portion, and not as good as other shaved snow places.",2.0
it was pretty bland and overpriced.,2.0
the beef was a little chewy and they don't use thai basil.,2.0
they take forever to do anything.,2.0
our plates were never cleared and our sodas never refilled.,2.0
i decided to sent the salmon patty back because  it wasn't good and undercooked.,2.0
"aside from that, they're nothing special.",2.0
how times have changed.,2.0
boy were we disappointed.,2.0
did not get napkins with dessert.,2.0
the cuts of meat were too fatty and some were thick and chewy!,2.0
at random intervals there would be loud drilling or hammering.,2.0
"marinara meat sauce was ok, but nothing that you cannot cook at home.",2.0
it was like we were eating with strangers on either side of us.,2.0
the service was very good but we left feeling pretty disappointed.,2.0
a good bit of heat but very little flavor.,2.0
the place is reminiscent of a concrete gym that needs to be decorated.,2.0
maybe i was expecting too much.,2.0
they tasted a bit stale.,2.0
"the decor is just ok, but what the place really needs is new flooring.",2.0
"ok. well, i won't be back here again!",2.0
way to expensive for what it is.,2.0
and they said it is my fault because my meat come from the same pork.,2.0
food is decent enough but hideously overpriced.,2.0
"well, then again maybe there was but the music was so loud!",2.0
the third time not so good.,2.0
not sure if i'll try this place again.,2.0
it just made it feel like we were getting cheated some how.,2.0
not much better this time!e around.,2.0
hamburgers should not be the highlight of a french restaurant.,2.0
"tried basil fried noodles, it wasn't great.",2.0
portions were very small.,2.0
ive eaten at egg works many times and was hoping for a good experience today.,2.0
hate to say it but it basically died after that.,2.0
"its not that it didn't flush, its that it was wierd.",2.0
used to be very good...,2.0
there are so many other places to get better sandwiches.,2.0
the food is over spiced and this cover the taste.,2.0
the resort has gone downhill since my last visit.,2.0
no sense of urgency from staff.,2.0
the shrimp still had the tails on them.,2.0
the food is expensive with small portions.,2.0
my husband's pulled pork sandwich was dry and not enough sauce.,2.0
"not the best food quality, great if you're in a hurry tho.",2.0
"the doctors are great, but i am very disappointed with the billing dept.",2.0
upscale and up pricingtoday's lunch was a disappointment.,2.0
get second opinions before going with their service center.,2.0
they are really disorganized and need to get it together.,2.0
"i know good thai food and this didn't taste bad, it just lacked authenticity.",2.0
a salad and an entrée ordered by our group were both completely overlooked.,2.0
"order, sit, and wait for your burger to be prepared.",2.0
"also, my fish became really cold very quickly because it was put on cold plate.",2.0
two stars for the extensive beer selection.,2.0
i guess he was too busy tweeting.,2.0
the pulled pork was oily and salty.,2.0
"the bread wasn't good, he couldn't taste the chicken, and the vegetables seemed dead.",2.0
the quality really took a nose dive in my opinion.,2.0
it definitely cheapened the place and lowered our expectations.,2.0
"definitely will not be back, despite the prime people watching location and laid back atmosphere.",2.0
we chose not to use sierra harwood floors in our new home due to this.,2.0
"however, since i did not enjoy the pizza, i will not return.",2.0
"i wanted to try the delicious shake, but i felt unwanted in this establishment.",2.0
the fries weren't anything special either.,2.0
the chicken breast was also very fatty.,2.0
the dining area was cramped and small.,2.0
very disappointed with this buffet but i guess i have to blame the economy...,2.0
the dosa was soggy and far from authentic.,2.0
ordered it medium rare and there wasnt a drop of juice in it.,2.0
"but in the last year the service, staff and food has gone down hill drastically.",2.0
just expected it to be a little cleaner for what i paid.,2.0
but my husband wanted to come and we were really hungry.,2.0
all their juice tastes the same.,2.0
four of the seven people at our table disliked their steaks.,2.0
they didn't have any of the ride on cars represented in the photos either.,2.0
the portions are large but the quality is meh.,2.0
it felt more like a more expensive beacher's madhouse.,2.0
nothing memorable about the place itself really.,2.0
"however, the show itself needs some work.",2.0
"i don't care how fancy a restaurant is, that is too long to wait.",2.0
i think the wallpaper goes back to that period and is downright dirty.,2.0
i would much rather have a cheaper drink.,2.0
but the staff that served us were inexperienced.,2.0
"food was mediocre at best, service was good.",2.0
very pricey burger joint!,2.0
the waitresses hovered and was annoying.,2.0
only one waitress and one chef are working on saturday lunch time.,2.0
there were flavors on the menu they said they didn't have that day.,2.0
i love chipotle so two stars but this location leaves much to be desired.,2.0
"overall, service is mediocre to bad depending on the night.",2.0
"it bubbled, and off it came.",2.0
"i read that the chunk chicken was awesome, well it wasn't.",2.0
there are much better places in vegas to spend your money!,2.0
finally the vinaigrette was too sweet.,2.0
"the sandwiches look really good, but the cookies were very stale and dry.",2.0
not sure if we'll do this again next year...sad.,2.0
i'll pay more next time to rent from a reputable location.,2.0
the fries were kind of boring and soggy.,2.0
that means i really don't like grease.,2.0
since arriving at crazy buffet my experience was unwelcoming nobody greeted us.,2.0
there is no seasoning just blah.,2.0
it wasn't terrible food but pretty expensive for what it was.,2.0
to top it off their sandwiches just aren't what i'm used to from jimmy johns.,2.0
i hope someone else has a better experience.,2.0
i also had a margarita which cost more than my meal!,2.0
there are much better options out there in terms of value and quality.,2.0
it was a bit of a turnoff.,2.0
"and with imelda, there doesn't seem to be any give, except cold attitude.",2.0
the music is very loud.,2.0
"we ordered chicken fajitas, shrimp ceviche and a side order of refried beans.",2.0
but the meal went downhill from there.,2.0
food is ok but service is extremely slow.,2.0
subs are great but unless you want it mike's way you're out of luck.,2.0
first time to be disappointed with papadeaux french bread.,2.0
the yogurt was kind of melty and not that tasty.,2.0
i'll give it two stars because the service wasn't that bad.,2.0
"interior and service are decent, but the food i would give one star.",2.0
"instead our waitress said ""i can bring you tomato juice.""",2.0
service was again very mediocre.,2.0
i really wish i could give this place a better rating but i just can't.,2.0

the service was friendly but not attentive.,2.0
"i know they just opened, and want feedback, but it really was overkill!",2.0
it took them a whole hour to get our dessert.,2.0
panna cotta was bland i didn't even finish.,2.0
came here last week and i was disappointed.,2.0
overall a below average burger.,2.0
"service was predictably, cripplingly slow.",2.0
the crispy shrimp rolls are not worth the price.,2.0
there are a lot better chinese restaurants out there.,2.0
we used to enjoy this place.,2.0
which was very expensive for what the hotel looked and smelled like.,2.0
i used to travel to that area a lot for work.,2.0
burgers not particularly noteworthy.,2.0
no bar for drinks.,2.0
it sounded better on paper than in reality.,2.0
i'll just stick with getting my bobas elsewhere.,2.0
the food was just ok and very slow to come out of the kitchen.,2.0
"typical americanized, sweetened dishes.",2.0
not for the quality you're getting.,2.0
if i'm ever in the north side again i may give this place another chance.,2.0
everything is over priced.,2.0
i ended up getting a pulled pork sandwich that wasn't great.,2.0
its like a high school cafeteria.,2.0

i don't think we would be going back anytime soon.,2.0
"fine setting, but way too expensive for what you are getting.",2.0
the chicken tenders were overcooked and hard to chew.,2.0
"if anything, the amount of meat in the sandwich is disappointing.",2.0
"very average if so, and expensive for the product.",2.0
my order has ultimately been accurately filled though.,2.0
the food is twice as expensive as taco bell and half as good.,2.0
they only carry caffeinated products which our family doesn't drink anyway.,2.0
which was also drenched in tomato sauce.,2.0
cocktails appear to be only sugar.,2.0
"cold french fries, total bushleague shit cyd.",2.0
"if my flight didn't have a decent layover, i would have missed it.",2.0
"but in terms of eating there again, not gonna happen.",2.0
good food is a large part of the experience but lousy service can wreck it.,2.0
also i did not get a strong smell of smoke inside the restaurant.,2.0
not a lot to the food and not much better atmosphere.,2.0
overpriced for the portion size you get.,2.0
all items could have been much warmer and much tastier.,2.0
the sandwiches were mostly stale bread with very little fixings on them.,2.0
i would love to go here regularly except the service is just really bad.,2.0
i wanted to like this pediatrician.,2.0
the restaurant and the food both need one badly.,2.0
i don't get the hype.,2.0
had to remake it and took forever.,2.0
"macarons chewy, gritty texture.",2.0
rooms are very outdated.,2.0
"i honestly have had better grocery store sushi, for the price they charge.",2.0
there are too many other options to give a try for me.,2.0
i'm looking for something positive to say and struggling.,2.0
"overall, it was just another meatball sub.",2.0
i had one slice and decided it wasn't very good.,2.0
overpriced for its quality.,2.0

took more than an hour to get our breadsticks.,2.0
"so then, go for the entrees, try a different soup, avoid the cabbage  rolls.",2.0
i don't think i'll be going back any time soon!,2.0
the place is expensive.,2.0
the napa cabbage salad was boring and bland.,2.0
had to ask for condiments after the food arrived and drinks took forever.,2.0
flavor was there but customer service was not pleasant.,2.0
i wanted to have great experience here.,2.0
it did not satisfy my mexican food craving at all.,2.0
"the quality has gone down consistently since my first visit, i won't be returning.",2.0
i didn't like it.,2.0
"it's nothing more than empty calories, and it does not feel very good going down.",2.0
the taco is so dry.,2.0
the fries we had we almost inedible.,2.0
nothing special to say about the servers.,2.0
"don't get me wrong, the ambience is awesome but the service put our experience down.",2.0
nice atmosphere but food was pretty bad for the price.,2.0
or maybe they just need a bell on the door.,2.0
i really wanted to have a great experience here.,2.0
bland tomato with some seafood topping and cherry tomatoes.,2.0
the food came very quick but was lukewarm at best.,2.0
very quiet and not very attentive.,2.0
"not to mention they use that cheap, thin cheese sauce that guarantees a heart attack.",2.0
"it doesn't matter what flavor of frosting it is, it all tastes the same.",2.0
"my mother ordered chicken salad, she didn't like the chicken at all.",2.0
i don't think i will return until there is a stricter protocol.,2.0
"the servers are nice, and it's cute... but the food is just not good.",2.0
"for dessert creme brulee, cold and burnt crust.",2.0
i found the bed uncomfortable.,2.0
the food is just not good and usually comes out cold.,2.0
i was underimpressed by this buffet.,2.0
i've definitely had better.,2.0
without the charm or shenanigans.,2.0
it definitely has cheap breakfast but it comes with bad taste.,2.0
"et que dire des prix, exorbitants pour la qualité des produits!",2.0
"very disappointing based on other baskets i've seen come out.. wings simple,  guess not.",2.0
it was pretty disappointing to say the least.,2.0
ordered the lunch special and it was barely eatable.,2.0
"overall, i'm sad the food wasn't good.",2.0
still suffering from the food.,2.0
cook times are long.,2.0
"for a renowned restaurant, i expected better service and food in general.",2.0
i had to take a long cold shower after my experience at mothership.,2.0
"i just don't see the value, there are so many other places to go.",2.0
took forever to get our drinks and food.,2.0
not a place i will rush back to for lunch.,2.0
"the less good news is that on the whole, everything we ordered was very underwhelming.",2.0
i got white tips and two of them were not on straight.,2.0
i have had my order made incorrectly quite a number of times.,2.0
our waitress was very slow and we were her only table.,2.0
also wasn't a fan of the filling in the strawberry one.,2.0
i am not a fan of the prices!,2.0
"also, the place was filthy.",2.0
"given its history in the area, i had high expectations, which unfortunately weren't fully met.",2.0

this doctor needs to practice his technique and show more regard for his patients.,2.0
the only redeeming quality was that my bf ordered an eggs benedict which was average.,2.0
this sandwich was not good.,2.0
this location compared to the tropicana and henderson location needs some serious help.,2.0

"rooms were small, tiny actually.",2.0
it's not the customer's fault for disorganized and inefficient line ups for ordering and paying.,2.0
"yes, you get what you pay for, but it is super expensive.",2.0
they were definitely rushing it.,2.0
the acts themselves were lackluster and i was underwhelmed the entire show.,2.0

customer service needs to be better if you want us to be back.,2.0

too many great breakfast places in scottsdale for this location to survive.,2.0
i didn't like it.,2.0
this is my least favorite location.,2.0

it was freezing in there.,2.0
probably will not go back here for a while.,2.0
but the breakfast was downright awful.,2.0
the salad had too many hard pieces.,2.0
massive doses of salt did not help.,2.0
they said if i didn't use travelocity it would have been different.,2.0
maybe it was because we went on our last day and were barely functioning.,2.0
plus not that much for what we paid.,2.0
service was lacklustre and i definitely won't return.,2.0
"the staff, while mostly friendly, do not seem to care about cleanliness.",2.0

the bread was over toasted so it was as hard as a rock.,2.0
inside was a thin slice of ham on a cheese base.,2.0

our waitress tried really hard but it just didn't work.,2.0
"i really wanted to like this place, but the food was not good.",2.0
the crispy noodles were not the same nor nearly as good.,2.0

over priced and bland .... small portions and salty.,2.0
"i asked for a clean up, she barely waxed them.",2.0
"moreover, that minimalist portion of sole was overcooked.",2.0

"too expensive for what it is, there are better thai places in the city.",2.0

no mini  fridge or microwave.,2.0
beware of wine prices.,2.0
the food was not that good.,2.0

"service is good, it's just not worth the money.",2.0
i definitely wouldn't recommend gallery sushi to anyone looking for good ayce.,2.0

it just didn't taste quite right.,2.0
i make better salads at home.,2.0
service is mediocre at best at this location.,2.0
the prices are stupid expensive for the type of burgers and appetizers they offered!,2.0

our waters and tea were left empty for long periods of time.,2.0
my sons also was bland.,2.0

"but overall, it was a rough experience.",2.0
the big but is that they are extremely bland.,2.0
she did not know anything about the menu and was not friendly.,2.0
which i was not very pleased about.,2.0
i was really disappointed and not worth the money.,2.0

the portions are small.,2.0
stopped by hobby lobby to get a few gift ideas.,2.0
i went a few times to give this a chance.,2.0
dumplings feel overcooked so the dough feels mushy.,2.0
"unfortunately, it's texture was certainly not my preference, and i'm not a picky eater.",2.0

the service was lacking as well.,2.0
"slow service, and the rice way way too salty.",2.0
overall just waaay too crowded aand dirty.,2.0
felt like i was at a chilis.,2.0
perhaps they are not used to customers who want to buy stuff.,2.0
two stars instead of one because of the beer selection.,2.0
person behind counter was apathetic and did not seem surprised at all.,2.0
"however, the food just wasn't that good.",2.0
i think it was very pricey.,2.0
it's okay but overpriced.,2.0
you're much better off going to bamiyan kebab down the street.,2.0
staff needs more help!!!,2.0
"i was looking forward to working with them, but they never followed through.",2.0
"nope, not what i wanted.",2.0

ordered some sushi rolls.,2.0
"our server was clueless, and overall service seemed very disorganized.",2.0
they weren't very child friendly.,2.0

"the songs, though logical in sequence, didn't seem to mesh well after one another.",2.0
"again, i removed the lettuce and ate the wrap.",2.0
both times my husband was done with his meal before i got mine.,2.0
your sandwiches will be oversliced and your salads overdiced.,2.0
my experience was far.,2.0
that's where it starts to fall apart.,2.0
i'm willing to pay them to fix my bike.,2.0
majority of entrees were empty.,2.0
the restaurant was apologetic but they only comp'ed us a drink.,2.0
"while they still have some great drink selections, the service has gotten so bad.",2.0
it had toppings thrown everywhere.,2.0
disappointed really i expected more because of the reviews i read on here.,2.0
there are  locations that demonstrate better quality of service.,2.0
"bread was mediocre, charged extra and they gave us a limited amount.",2.0
i'm sure they couldn't be we feel full with their dishes..,2.0
the lattes we bought however were not very good.,2.0
i don't know if it was over cooked or had sat a little too long.,2.0
i don't know if my expectations were high or if they were just that mediocre.,2.0
but for customer service forget it.,2.0
normally this would fill the two of us up but we're both starving.,2.0
only reason they're getting two stars is because the food was alright.,2.0
we felt let down by the organization for sure.,2.0
"i've had better, a lot better.",2.0
all underwhelming and over priced for what you were getting.,2.0
. . so not worth it.,2.0
won't be open long unless they make some serious changes.,2.0
"and with the prices, i expected more.",2.0
"the hashbrowns, which used to be a high point, were mushy.",2.0

it was bland and kinda dry!!,2.0
we had multiple things that were not good.,2.0
not the best i've had to be honest.,2.0

"something that a well trained, caring waitress should have noticed.",2.0
steak was dry and over cooked.,2.0
the menu is much more expensive.,2.0

"incredibly overpriced, mediocre food.",2.0
"over the years, the quality of the food and the service had declined.",2.0
food came out cold.,2.0
"service is better at lunch but not by much, sticking with nellos!",2.0
that could be another reason why the service is so slow.,2.0
i gave an extra star only because they have coke in a bottle.,2.0
you may see a performer or two.,2.0
"overall this place has potential, given better cooks and wait staff.",2.0
adding lots of starch to thicken instead of real cream or butter .,2.0
"our son had an omelet, which was so dry he couldn't eat it.",2.0
the price of the food is high for cafeteria quality.,2.0
expensive for what you get... portions were quite small for the price.,2.0
everything tasted really bland .,2.0
drinks are expensive and super sugary.,2.0
i ordered a burger medium well and it was oozing red on the inside.,2.0
prices are high for a chain restaurant.,2.0
i rarely eat dinners this expensive.,2.0
"the broth was not as flavourful as other places, nor was the beef.",2.0
over crowded during dinner time on weekendsdefinitely violated building occupancy code.,2.0
my husband ordered a beer that took a while to arrive.,2.0
the wings weren't that juicy.,2.0
expected the food to be a lot better.,2.0
"i did not try their gelato, but the pizza was terrible.",2.0
this place is overpriced and everything is a la cart.,2.0
now back to why our last experience was just simply terrible.,2.0
hope your experience is better than ours...,2.0
"not many people there, but still took forever for the order.",2.0
i hope the kitchen knows that there working in the airport speed is a necessity.,2.0
they need new equipment.,2.0
everything from service to the meal itself was a letdown.,2.0
i expected more from you.,2.0
they rarely get it right.,2.0
i've definitely had better and i truly feel like i wasted my money.,2.0
so i purchased one of these hair grooming machines and just needed a cape.,2.0
the chicken was undercooked and pink.,2.0
"aside from that, not much to recommend it.",2.0
but when you order delivery the food and service get lousy!,2.0
"i only had a few of them, it was more like eating potato chips.",2.0
"however, check the price of a beer before you buy it.",2.0
the two stars are for the ambiance which is fun and upbeat and loud.,2.0
when the delivery guy is the highlight of your dealing with them...,2.0
i guess that made up for the mediocre food.,2.0
but the last few times i have gone have been disappointing.,2.0
the table next to me had an omelet and the eggs looked burned as well.,2.0
my biggest problem with this location is the issues with cleanliness.,2.0
as i write this i am shaking my head in dissapointment.,2.0
patio and bar service has gotten progressively worse.,2.0
"sorry, the lenses didn't come out right and we'll have to send them in.",2.0
the area to get ready after showering was not comfortable....,2.0
"part of my meal came with sushi, which was below average.",2.0
the food was good but very unfriendly staff members.,2.0
there is no soup but bunch of other food in there.,2.0
just don't expect much professionalism and you'll be fine.,2.0
other then that took a while for drinks and for waitress to collect our bill.,2.0
i felt food is over priced.,2.0
the bathroom was dirty.,2.0
i was asked if i wanted a refill for my drink.,2.0
my experience in the store was very upsetting.,2.0
it seems to me that they need to invest in much better ingredients.,2.0
the dough was bland as was the tomato sauce.,2.0
i'd have to have some significant incentive to try this place again.,2.0
it just seems like an oasis of fakeness and exorbitance.,2.0
very pricey to match.,2.0
the dessert selection was sad.,2.0
service was soooo slow.,2.0
it's just not worth the price and the walk.,2.0
i don't recommend unless you're starting with appetizers and ending with dessert.,2.0
"i had such high expectations because of the reviews, and was let down.",2.0
"pretty disappointing overall, i really wanted to like these guys.",2.0

"it's essentially mexican food, plain and simple.",2.0

"the only way i can describe my rueben was it was off, just off.",2.0
"thus, i was disappointed with the wait.",2.0

it seemed harder than frodos quest in lord of the rings.,2.0
place needs a service overhaul badly,2.0
we both kind of lost the taste for fish.,2.0
"it was typical diner prices but for what you get, it ain't worth it.",2.0

staff not very friendly or organized.,2.0
"portions are smaller than those served at monami, but you pay the same prices.",2.0
my family and i ate here recently and we were disappointed.,2.0
the sushi rice was not cooked thoroughly or they used old sushi rice.,2.0
my daughter's extra sauce we had to ask our server.,2.0

"atmosphere was very old, guess it's good for families.",2.0
third time i have been here first poor service...kitchen was busy but no excuse.,2.0
not worth it to me.,2.0
there are much better thai restaurants in the phoenix area.,2.0
"over the past year or so, the room has stated to change.",2.0
"for me, it was the attitude and that he was obviously packing heat.",2.0
nothing new... no new restaraunts.,2.0
"and the food, fry's seem not as fresh and few on first order.",2.0
there must be better italian in charlotte.,2.0
"then waitress refilled my water, only her pour added a small bug.",2.0
again nothing i didn't expect except for the service.,2.0
the car bombs were made incorrectly.,2.0
"it was tough, and had the texture of memory foam.",2.0
both were filled with families seeming to be enjoying themselves and their food.,2.0
at least they didn't charge me for the for their learning experience.,2.0
the roasted potatoes that came with the burger were soggy.,2.0
"like many yelpers have said, the portions here are pretty skimpy.",2.0
both were dry and lacking.,2.0
sauces could use some refining as there isn't any a traditional sauce as a choice.,2.0
i asked for lettuce tomatoes and add pickles.,2.0

"too much talking, not enought magic.",2.0
well to this day it still hurts.,2.0

but what stood out the most was the poor service.,2.0
bad reception from the hostess.,2.0
the festivals were really dry.,2.0
so probably not ideal place to take your date.,2.0
been here twice already and they manage to mess my order up both times.,2.0
i paid extra to have the lo mein and was expecting something good.,2.0
i can't think of a reason why i should be back.,2.0
"overall, i don't think i will be back any time soon.",2.0
overall just not a great experience and defiantly not worth the money we paid.,2.0
i also ordered the onion fry lamb dish which was just as salty and oily.,2.0
probably won't be coming back.,2.0
"also, the bread arrived after my entire main dish was consumed.",2.0
the place needs a menu and decor makeover.,2.0
for such a hyped up place i definitely expected much better food and service,2.0
no microwave and no coffee machine in building.,2.0
"everytime, we need something we have to take pains to catch hold of someone.",2.0
"i meandered around for quite some time after this, still nothin.",2.0
"always loved the wild wing franchise, but this one was so dirty.",2.0

but everything is more expensive at this location and service is so slow!,2.0
"also, they were pretty bland.",2.0
when the food came we did not receive the side pasta.,2.0
i have had better seafood linigui at other establishments.,2.0

"overall, the food was very bland.",2.0
same  with the tahini dressing which did not have enough lemon.,2.0

"it was bland, nothing special at all.",2.0
"i got a lemon and an orange chocolate, and both were soggy.",2.0

so i'll be eating my fee i paid for the two months and going elsewhere.,2.0
disappointed in the way they changed making their nachos.,2.0
"honestly, i'm not sure why this place gets so much hype.",2.0
this used to be a good place to eat.,2.0
"however, our mains is what left me unimpressed with this restaurant.",2.0
the bread was fantastic but the meat looked and tasted like low quality deli meat.,2.0
"however, based on the food served to us then, i will not go back.",2.0
just not up to par on food for my standards of bbbq.,2.0
"they shells were dry and it was not chewy at all, not even a bit.",2.0

"oddly disappointing, and something that should be simple to do.",2.0
"i don't consider myself a foodie, but the food was very bland all and all.",2.0
i don't think we are staying here again even if the points are less..,2.0
the hallway is of dark reddish brown walls and our room had a black toilet.,2.0
perfect size if you are watching your weight... two stars for great service.,2.0
the second complaint is that the service is very hit or miss.,2.0
the main buffet line is like a cafeteria on steroids.,2.0
"i have eaten in many excellent las vegas restaurants, this was not one of them.",2.0
i was also disappointed they didn't have shoyu ramen as an option.,2.0
"was going to order for our holiday party at work, but not from here.",2.0
it's definitely overpriced for what it offers.,2.0
the service was bad.,2.0
other than that thx for the heartburn and the non existent service.,2.0
"not bad, but will not be returning.",2.0
service has been poor all but one of those times.,2.0
i'm tired of eating at mediocre joints in little italy.,2.0

the hot ones are not hot.,2.0
the pizza looked very different from their website.,2.0
next our waitress while filling my water also poured the water over my foot.,2.0
by the way it didn't rain for two days.,2.0
both times service was less than average.,2.0
seems like they prioritize takeout so everyone in the restaurant has to wait much longer.,2.0
"overall the food was underwhelming, the environment loud and crowded, the service ok to terrible.",2.0
it seemed like way too much hair was coming off but was hard to tell.,2.0
next time we're in scottsdale we'll go elsewhere.,2.0
don't even think about using the beach and large pools.,2.0
"i'm again, not cool.",2.0
so don't know about it.,2.0
"not very busy, but food still took a long time to come out.",2.0
this place used to be fantastic.,2.0
so disappointed as the food is good.,2.0
you'll be waiting so long you'll finally be hungry when the food arrives.,2.0
the food was an entirely different story.,2.0
store is really unorganized.,2.0
overall the food is below average and definitely not worth the price tag.,2.0

"i wouldn't seek this place out, but at least i wouldn't refuse to come back.",2.0
"ordered the whole chicken but it was quite small, like malnourished and no taste.",2.0
i believe i have experienced better bagels at the grocery store.,2.0
the salsa was not tasty in my opinion.,2.0
they should move to full service and forget the whole ordering in line.,2.0
went with a few friends and had a not so good experience.,2.0
"the wife had been craving bagels, we were excited.",2.0
"i liked his work, but i won't be going back due to his dishonesty.",2.0

the job seems pretty basic...something is off there!!,2.0
not impressed with the food at all.,2.0
i didn't see the renown deck.,2.0
my wrap and sweet potato fries were very bland.,2.0
there are much better places to eat thai food in charlotte.,2.0
go elsewhere in the area for the amount of money that you will spend.,2.0
just so many line ups...everywhere.,2.0
i probably wouldnt come back unless other breakfast joints are closed.,2.0
the booth seating was sticky.,2.0
french onion soup was poor tasting.,2.0
things are changing with dennys and not for the better.,2.0
i was also not overly impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant.,2.0
you end up paying a buck more for every other little item you add.,2.0
the seafood lasagna sautee had an overwhelming odor.,2.0

the availability of shoes here is very low.,2.0
food was just so so.,2.0

the place is way too bright.,2.0

"don't come to anejo if you are looking for good, authentic mexican food.",2.0
and if you do buy food here expect it to be bad tasting.,2.0
mango lassi was undrinkable with bits of crusty dry yogurt.,2.0
"decor and stuff is ok but let's face it, the food is mediocre.",2.0
the only reason this review isn't one star is because i didn't see any roaches.,2.0
"overall, i tend to find things myself but this staff is severely lacking.",2.0
there's nothing really wrong with it but there's certainly nothing great about it either.,2.0

the food was ok but didn't live up to what we had expected.,2.0
i was   disappointed .,2.0
dealt with another pushy stereotypical car salesman type here while searching for a used car.,2.0
i was quite disappointed.,2.0
"there could have been more inside, i didn't check.",2.0
"i am not a burlesque connoisseur, but expected to be titillated.",2.0
i thought the caramelized salmon was a bad idea.,2.0
the food has tasted bland even when asking for medium spice.,2.0
not the best experience for the money.,2.0
it was not in the right direction.,2.0
car wash wasn't good either.,2.0
i had a burger that was okay but i wouldn't order again.,2.0
maybe it wasn't supposed to be there.,2.0
finished second beer and fries just as the vinegar arrived.,2.0
i takes forever to get your soup.,2.0
"also no detectable muzak, making it a hushed, awkward atmosphere.",2.0
the habit burger is a glorified carl's junior with not as many options.,2.0
the taste cannot match an average restaurant.,2.0
service here is meh.,2.0
i had to supervise way too much.,2.0
sales staff is pushy and a little rude.,2.0
nothing like arriving to the airport reeking of cheap air freshener and stale smoke.,2.0
i used to love this place.,2.0
"the wings were hot, but the sliders cold.",2.0
the burger was edible but certainly not fantastic.,2.0
full patronage is not a valid excuse for the length of time.,2.0
"fried rice, very oily, see pic.",2.0
"specular some said, but it's just a beef roll with firework.",2.0
"too sweet, too expensive.",2.0
"constant annoying country ""music"" playing while the big screen showing the playoff game was muted.",2.0
this place has really gone down hill since i've been here.,2.0
the chicken was super oily and rice clumped together.,2.0
the food is average at best.,2.0
"i only ordered drinks, but boy was i disappointed with their  mojito.",2.0
"burgers were fair , fries were not good .",2.0
i was truly disappointed about my membership nit being respected.,2.0
i don't understand what the hype is around reposado.,2.0
they only have one credit card machine so checking out took even longer.,2.0
their chips and guac isn't even made with real avocados.,2.0
i didn't hate it but i wouldn't go back.,2.0
"however, at this location, i feel like the bartenders are always annoyed.",2.0
"our server on multiple occasions has been sour, distant, non observant.",2.0
"unripe tomatoes, barely any bacon.",2.0
"then she's like we're  out of that, that, and that.",2.0
"great service, terrible meal.",2.0
shop at your peril.,2.0
"it was also loud, and freezing because they had the back door propped open.",2.0
the bottles were behind the counter and couldn't really see them or the labels.,2.0
"i asked for an oval shape, and i received more of an almond shape.",2.0
when i brought this to my waiters attention he seemed put out that i complained.,2.0
yet another over hyped downtown toronto restaurant.,2.0
the price was a little for the quality of food.,2.0
not a good experience.,2.0
"nevertheless, a lot of food, albeit plain, for the price.",2.0
"and by the way, the salad was brown!",2.0
you feel as though you are eating in an airport restaurant.,2.0
flavor was way off and presentation was just a bad.,2.0
but nothing that i would ever feel the need to go back for.,2.0
"when we got the ticket, chelsia, the waitress, charged me for the salad.",2.0
kind of tasted like plain white congee mixed with cumin.,2.0
btw this is not hakata style ramen.,2.0
foods the same but prices are up and service is down.,2.0
everything is ala carte which means expensive for bar food.,2.0
so much so the bun was soggy.,2.0
desserts were a disappointment once you tasted them.,2.0
i was totally underwhelmed.,2.0
"again, not much variety.",2.0
"fast service, weak drinks.",2.0
"started with the lobster bisque, blandest i've ever had.",2.0
had high hopes as another good option.,2.0
getting the usps involved is likely why i can't find my order.,2.0
might be a good place for an awkward first date.,2.0
the sandwich was pretty much inedible.,2.0
second one got us drinks.,2.0
additionally  if you want more dip sauce you will have to pay additional for it.,2.0
the rice was horrible but the beans were very good.,2.0
they also suffered from being underseasoned and overcooked.,2.0
i had the pork tenderloin...mediocre at best and the mole sauce was horrible.,2.0
i won't be back... time to try the fairmont scottsdale,2.0
i asked for well done potatoes which came out close to raw.,2.0
"they are quite snobby to, just stand around talking amongst themselves.",2.0
"the cheese is like rubber, but the crust is chewy.",2.0
wanted to watch some sports but they couldn't figure out what channel had them on,2.0
very disappointed because when we dine in everything is usually top notch...,2.0
the sandwich was cold.,2.0
the chicken was a bit cold when we got it and the tortillas tasted stale.,2.0
"pizza, when it arrived, was fine, but nothing worth enduring the service for.",2.0
not terrible sushi but i've had better elsewhere.,2.0
the pedicure was super rushed and it was slow at the salon.,2.0
"any less friendly, and you woulda thought i intruded into someone's lunch.",2.0
"the server justified it by saying ""it sometimes turns out this way"".",2.0
not much  value for you money.,2.0
"they have a poor range of sizes in the older bikes, which are horribly maintained.",2.0
i could have saved sooooooo much time if i'd started at asreb ...and some money.,2.0
i had to check on the waitress to even order an appetizer.,2.0
have a beer and eat elsewhere.,2.0
rice was hard on inside but overall mushy.,2.0
the food was ok not much flavor on the chicken.,2.0
this location just needs better management.,2.0
"they didn't do anything wrong per say, just not a great experience.",2.0
and at the same quality.,2.0
it came out luke warm and the main ingredient was potatoes.,2.0
"i don't know when these are checked, but it looked like it had been days.",2.0
i had the beef tartar which was bland.,2.0
"whatever convenience wayne gretsky's bar and grill offers, is sadly outweighed by its flavorless food.",2.0
the waitress was very abrupt and delivered mediocre service.,2.0
the menues are sticky.,2.0
"they only give you soap, shampoo and lotion.",2.0
i've had lunch here and diner both times were very disappointed.,2.0
we have baked better pizzas at our home.,2.0
well think it's over priced for the portion they give you.,2.0
from there everything went downhill.,2.0
the juices and smoothies are all pre made which was such a bummer.,2.0
the french fries were neither crispy nor flavourful.,2.0
essentially was an expensive snack.,2.0
the service was sub par.,2.0
but the veggies side was also very flavorless and greasy.,2.0
"also, the bathroom is super cramped!",2.0
the decor is very worn and dated.,2.0
teriyaki too thin and nothing great not bad.,2.0
the location of this place is sketchy and uninviting.,2.0
super excited to try this out but.... wasn't thrilled.,2.0
"the food on the other hand was blah, it had no flavor.",2.0
definitely not worth the wait because the service was brutal.,2.0
"not wonderful, just good.",2.0
"the flatbread was on the tasteless side, the pasta was too spicy.",2.0
a lot of staff but some were just walking around not really doing anything.,2.0
i do suggest to try for a simple lunch but not for a meal.,2.0
i've noticed they have started to skimp on portions.,2.0
service was pretty slow when i went.,2.0
the stations are small the food is at times cold and dry.,2.0
"if we return, we will definitely try something else instead.",2.0
"otherwise, the food becomes dumbed down to american tastes.",2.0
i don't get the good reviews.,2.0
"regrettably, my lasting impression was not entirely a pleasant one.",2.0
...then table that sat next to us ordered same plate with only shrimp.,2.0
the soup looks boring.,2.0
"this is your standard, generic chinese food restaurant.",2.0
they do respond to service requests but nothing's ever fixed.,2.0
"not what i was expecting after all of the ""vintage vegas"" hype.",2.0
"wouldn't recommend this place unless it was for a kids cut, maybe.",2.0
the veggies were overcooked and the sauce thin and tasteless.,2.0
can't see how much you owe or if they got a payment or anything.,2.0
i remained unimpressed by the eggs and other breakfast items that my table ordered.,2.0
i barely ordered anything.,2.0
food was mediocre... salad was good.,2.0
i am especially disappointed in their produce.,2.0
it seemed like there was only one server for the tables in the bar area.,2.0
"this place is too ""trendy"".",2.0
the sashimi is cut so small its smaller than my baby pinky finger.,2.0
at least the shank was ok. definitely have had better.,2.0
totally redid their menu and now the prices really are outrageous.,2.0
"the changes are, sadly, not good.",2.0
"sad, used to be a good place.",2.0
so we went for the easter brunch and it was a huge disappointment.,2.0
additionally there were several discrepancies with the billing that came up from time to time.,2.0
"we tried some other dishes, they were only ""so so"".",2.0
the ribs were chewy and didn't finish them.,2.0
at least it was relatively cheap.,2.0
it would not have been so bad if the food didnt suck so much.,2.0
"overtime, quality has gone way down and prices are way up.",2.0
there are much better places to eat in vegas .,2.0
shrimp were overcooked and noodles were all stuck together.,2.0
"i asked why and he said ""that's the way it's been for years.""",2.0
servers are very young and don't seem to be in a very good mood.,2.0
disappointing as this place used to be a go to when i was younger.,2.0
now the quality of the food was average.,2.0
and i feel like it's just too pricey for what it's worth.,2.0
sorry my event was unsuccessful.,2.0
i don't get it.,2.0
the tables are so close together and service is soooooo slow.,2.0
will not likely go back.,2.0
the coffee was mediocre.,2.0
they need some people with personality and professionalism and everyone would make better money.,2.0
food was barely decent and presentation was quite poor.,2.0
"the food over all was just ok, not the great experience it used to be.",2.0
the mac n cheese was hardly enough for a small child.,2.0
"my daughter had a gargantuan plate of nachos that were just mediocre, nothing special.",2.0
the chicken has a completely different taste.,2.0
"i got a massage here and the massage therapist i had, matt, was subpar.",2.0
they weren't even so i had to try to trim them myself.,2.0
customer service is lower and staff does not listen to their customers orders.,2.0
"all in all, such a weird place.",2.0
and they always mess my order up either forgetting something or not doing it right.,2.0
"i ordered the pulled pork sandwich, jalapeño coleslaw, and dirty rice.",2.0
"but waaay too much celery, that wasn't cooked very well.",2.0
"unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with our most recent experience.",2.0
for the price of the meal at the very least you'd expect it served warm.,2.0
i tried this place a few years ago and wasn't impressed.,2.0
people don't seem to be having too much fun.,2.0
the bread was unremarkable and the lovely fresh ingredients on it seemed sort of unexciting.,2.0
it just doesn't do it for us.,2.0
you won't stay hungry in this place it's just nothing special.,2.0
too slow in my opinion.,2.0
she grudgingly  agreed to put in an order for me.,2.0
mac and cheese on my partner's burger was cold.,2.0
maybe they ran out of garlic.,2.0
teenage staff needs coaching on customer service.,2.0
"lastly, the service is slow and not nearly friendly enough.",2.0
"when i asked about the breeding conditions for the animals, i got major attitude.",2.0
"might head back for the drinks, not so much for the food.",2.0
but i didn't feel really well after the dinner.,2.0
"steak was ok, bland taste.",2.0
our orders were then rushed through and finally our meals made it to the table.,2.0
"the food here is consistent and decent, but their service sucks to the core.",2.0
we didn't always have hot water.,2.0
not much of a fan to begin with.,2.0
waiters and waitresses just could not get it together.,2.0
"just would be nice ti check out and get a smile, cashiers seem miserable!!",2.0
everything missed the mark except the check .,2.0
i don't understand how that can happen.,2.0
the paneer itself was very rubbery in texture.,2.0
only time she seemed to enjoy her job was when it came to the rules.,2.0
don't expect great service here.,2.0
i've been here a few times and each time it has been painfully slow.,2.0
i can see no reason to go back.,2.0
"two stars for cheap drinks and good music, though.",2.0
stopped by for a margarita before we went across the street to dinner.,2.0
not that busy at the time.,2.0
the curds were old....no squeak.,2.0
the service was terrible so it diminished my experience and i probably will never return.,2.0
the side mashed potatoes were served on the cold side.,2.0
"the crust of the crepe was crunchy, the dressing of the salad was too thick.",2.0
came here to get my shellac manicure done here.,2.0
"we ordered fries,an appetizers and a beer.",2.0
i don't think that my family and i would come back.,2.0
"i am not one with food allergies, except to msg.",2.0
"not only is it not a chain, it is not very good.",2.0
"however, extremely expensive compared to all other south asian restaurants.",2.0
"but, recently they seem to have quality control issues.",2.0
the rack's sale prices are just about the same as last chance prices now.,2.0
it seems other people have had similar experiences.,2.0
"ordered pizza, sub, fries, wings, none of which were hot.",2.0
"the drinks were strong, which at least made it tolerable.",2.0
"if you're particular about microwaved food, you know it gives it a different taste.",2.0
clearly their quality has gone down over time!,2.0
this is kind of a tough one.,2.0
"not the kind of show, or bar to be worrying about some bo.",2.0
the lack of freshness and flavor were the biggest factors in sutra's failure.,2.0
the only thing worth eating for the price was the bread basket with olive tapenade.,2.0
"short ribs fatty, moules, too much rosemary, salmon, fine, wine selection limited.",2.0
the drink station wasn't kept up either.,2.0
the food is something else.,2.0
turkey dish looked promising from the sample.,2.0
"however, the kid working the counter was truly obnoxious.",2.0
cold noodles were underwhelming.,2.0
i would rather to eat at the other chinese food places than this one.,2.0
unfortunately  the cake itself was super dense and odd tasting for a vanilla cake.,2.0
i started with what was supposed to be tom yun soup.,2.0
waited forty min for my order.,2.0
two specifics were that the pizza was lukewarm and the bacon didn't seem cooked through.,2.0
not very friendly staff and wifi only works part of the time.,2.0
paying your check is equally bad as register operations and payments seem to take forever.,2.0
but the food sucked last two times and the service was so so.,2.0
they seemed lacking flavor or drenched with too much sauce to add flavor.,2.0
it wasn't even busy.,2.0
customer service needs to improve,2.0
food is so so slow.,2.0
wasn't that busy for it to take so long to get served.,2.0
the cashier who worked here this morning was completely unpleasant.,2.0
the sweet tea was below average in quality.,2.0
the pool side service is poor.,2.0
not sure i'll return because of the food.,2.0
this is the second time we have had problems with food here.,2.0
"i've been here twice, for brunch and dinner, and was both times disappointed.",2.0
the services staff was the main issue.,2.0
"so, the front desk and service are clearly not on the same page.",2.0
nothing special at all.,2.0
"the food though, i was disappointed.",2.0
"the fish burger was very dry, and the salad a bit bland.",2.0
they don't have a design book to choose from.,2.0
we kind of felt ignored by the waiter.,2.0
"trust me, way overpriced.",2.0
"i took out the seafood to try just the noodles, and still couldn't eat it.",2.0
ordered meatballs and they were dry.,2.0
the rice was lacking mirin and had a faint taste of sushi rice.,2.0
another waiter was trying to clear everything off of our table at rapid speed.,2.0
i had to add piles of hot sauce just to get some flavor.,2.0
joe c was my service guy and he was kind of rude to my questions.,2.0
i probably won't be back as there are much better options.,2.0
but the food was not acceptable this time so we won't be going back.,2.0
they didn't have the fried oreos either!,2.0
bathroom sink drained super slow so that was annoying.,2.0
"i have to admit, walking away with my lima lunchbox today was pretty disappointing.",2.0
i really wanted to like this place.,2.0
"first, the place was loud and dark, and frankly, pretentious.",2.0
the portions may be big but the flavor it's blah.....,2.0
chipotle sliders had a splash of chipotle dry seasoning on them.,2.0
it's like they had an order of loaded nachos and added my tamales.,2.0
this doesn't bode well for my trust in their mechanics.,2.0
greed at work is not a pretty sight.,2.0
the staff is always changing and they don't appear to like animals.,2.0
it was advertised as near the airport but it was not.,2.0
"as usual, customer service of this location is lacking.",2.0
the instructor would not let up on suggesting i get a trim...,2.0
service was extremely slow at lunch time.,2.0
everything is usually cold or too greasy l.,2.0
"not good, not bad.",2.0
"service was excellent and the atmosphere was fun, but the food was a let down.",2.0
burger and prime rib sliders were a major disappointment and did not get eaten.,2.0
probably won't return because of the disappointing experience.,2.0
it ruined a otherwise nice sunday afternoon family dinner.,2.0
i didn't like their system of ordering tacos.,2.0
"again, i do not understand  the popularity of this restaurant.",2.0
especially if she if feeding large family groups of which seem to happen here.,2.0
"the noodles themselves were hard, and the i found broth lacking in flavour.",2.0
not worth the money with so many other great mexican restaurants in the area.,2.0
very expensive and you don't get much for your money.,2.0
"no idea, all i know was that this time here it was not very good.",2.0
"today, i wasn't as impressed, but it could be what i ordered.",2.0
"the steak was dry and over cooked, and my tacos literally fell apart.",2.0
"after eating at grimaldi's, we still aren't sure what all the fuss is about.",2.0
also the cocktails were not anything to remember.,2.0
the service was less than tolerable.,2.0
i wanted to love this place but.,2.0
too expensive for services done.,2.0
"it did taste good, but a rip off.",2.0
"as with most boston pizza locations, the food is kind of mediocre, nothing really special.",2.0
very bland and doughy.,2.0
"tammy, who took care of me, was not friendly nor a good listener.",2.0
we finish our food with nothing to drink.,2.0
for a franchise ... this was done ao poorly ..,2.0
this was my first and probably my last time eating sushi.,2.0
the toppings have even a less of variety and were all just about empty.,2.0
apologies accepted but  we probably wouldn't go back.,2.0
flavours were bland and they were reeeeeally skimpy on the meat.,2.0
this place really isn't that good.,2.0
the hash brown were a little mushy and bland.,2.0
even though everything was suppose to be covered.,2.0
we felt like we were being rushed.,2.0
honestly...they weren't that good.,2.0
"otherwise, they won't sell you the drink.",2.0
i probably won't be back as it's ridiculously overpriced.,2.0
"so, if you are behind a slow driver that is your experience.",2.0
i used to like this place but today it was a big fiasco.,2.0
now its loud and they'll serve drinks to anyone.,2.0
had the slowest service.,2.0
the spaghetti sauce was bland and odd.,2.0
the music was also very loud making it hard to talk and hear each other.,2.0
they seemed more concerned with chatting amongst themselves than working the bar.,2.0
he said it usually is less carbonated.,2.0
"all in all, leaves a lot to be desired.",2.0
"the food itself was below expectation, was pretty disappointed from the high reviews",2.0
the menu is nothing like the original pizza factories.,2.0
"the concept is great, but both my wife and i were disappointed with the execution.",2.0
"unfortunately, none of the items i selected have me wanting to return.",2.0
repeated inconsistent service and food quality have made this place hit or miss.,2.0
my medium burger was grilled beyond well done and the veggie burger lacks taste.,2.0
like i could make it better and i barely know how to cook.,2.0
most restaurants would have at the very least apologized for the bones in the sushi.,2.0
food was average at best.,2.0
price is high too for what you're getting.,2.0
service was the only great thing i would compliment on.,2.0
food is oily and covered with seasoning.,2.0
so heavily salted that i'm retching a little thinking about them.,2.0
i think staff should be upped on busy days.,2.0
well in someone's review i read that the music wasn't great.,2.0
the servers just are not up to par.,2.0
the wings are average at best.,2.0
but..where it falls is the quality of the food.,2.0
ditched pho kim long because the line was way too long.,2.0
teally gone down hill!,2.0
"the person working the window was very polite, but seemed totally disorganized.",2.0
the service was extremley slow.,2.0
the lunch wasn't filling.,2.0
somewhat dirty with a distinct odor.,2.0
sales staff are not as well trained as you would think.,2.0
i've had much better at carraba's and i'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants.,2.0
it was a let down.,2.0
"i was charged full price, but the waitress changed it when i notified her.",2.0
the burger was nothing noteworthy.,2.0
average or below average breakfast food.,2.0
the ingredients did not have any interesting or fresh flavors.,2.0
"my daughter's chicken parmesan was dry and overcooked, and the pasta was dry.",2.0
"the wings, which used to be the main draw for me, are smaller and dry.",2.0
this restaurant is awkward looking and near my work.,2.0
it gets faxed to them sometime after your place your order.,2.0
lot of money spent on decor.,2.0
it was honestly the strangest experience ever.,2.0
"it came in the smallest glass, was ok but way too sweet.",2.0
maybe even not that.,2.0
d.c's attempt at being funny was pathetic.,2.0
ill just get somthing different.,2.0
however it is a family oriented place and i don't suggest going for dates there.,2.0
they have pressed sushi but the ratio of rice to fish is heavy.,2.0
"anyway, if the service were better i'd give it a better rating.",2.0
everything else was fine but these experiences really ruined my stay.,2.0
"once it gets busy, the service gets slow as well.",2.0
i wish i tasted more for what i paid for but not.,2.0
"atmosphere is cute, but the food was such a disappointment.",2.0
they quoted the same price for one person per year vs. two.,2.0
spend a couple of extra bucks and go across the street to rodney's.,2.0
i used to really like this place...,2.0
"unfortunately, we were immediately disappointed by the behavior of our server.",2.0
there server also forgot one of our drink orders.,2.0
"the food was pretty disappointing, didn't look so appetizing.",2.0
"i simply can't understand the lengthy wait for such a small, unremarkable portion.",2.0
not really worth the hype in our opinions.,2.0
they get charged the adult price too.,2.0
but coming to the other food items they are not a good place to eat.,2.0
perhaps they should focus on their job instead of chatting with other employees.,2.0
the sangria was without fruity flavor but has high alcohol content.,2.0
the taro blended drinks are gritty and overpriced.,2.0
the only good thing is it was quite clean and nice service at the restaurant.,2.0
"just another dark, smoky local place.",2.0
"it's ordinary, predictable, unremarkable, and uninteresting.",2.0
asked for my steak medium and it came raw.,2.0
"greasy food, slow service!",2.0
"my friend got the breakfast sliders, which were cold.",2.0
we went here for dinner with family and were really disappointed.,2.0
unfortunately the service is usually poor.,2.0
this location needs to step up its game.,2.0
"overall, flavors weren't very good or special enough to warrant a return.",2.0
"maybe a meat meal would have been better, i'll never know.",2.0
just can't stomach the conditions inside this coffee house any longer.,2.0
"and since portions are small, you kind of leave feeling hungry.",2.0
"my advice to others would be to consider the dish's impact on spice, e.g.",2.0
"just a ""meh"" experience.",2.0
but mediocre selection and high prices will keep us away.,2.0
nothing special about this place.,2.0
pizza with added prochutto was over cooked.,2.0
i would think twice about going there again.....,2.0
wine list is extremely limited and narrow is scope...they had one pinot noir.,2.0
very little food served for so much money.,2.0
"the ""meat"" loaf barely qualified as meat.",2.0
i really wanted to like this place.,2.0
once i did get my burger it wasn't even that good.,2.0
"hoping for better, i moved on to the beef curry pad thai.",2.0
no thank you or enthusiasm.,2.0
"however, based on my experience, the food availability appears to be unreliable.",2.0
i expected a more enjoyable experience at this restaurant.,2.0
my steak came out very undercooked and rare.,2.0
and it was quite the experience to say the least.,2.0
this was not the same experience.,2.0
definitely had better deep tissue.,2.0
you are paying for the lounge ambiance with an uncharismatic wait staff.,2.0
it just didn't feel professional.,2.0
"although the ice cream is big, it is not that good.",2.0
there's an equal amount of plus's and minus's.,2.0
the service that night was frustrating.,2.0
"chicken looked a bit dry, so i didn't bother.",2.0
they are what the front office staff used to be.,2.0
"i ordered the hanger steak, medium.",2.0
i thought the buffet was below average.,2.0
"friend got the big daddy pancake, greasy and not that tasty.",2.0
it was also not inexpensive.,2.0
"the opera cake was also old and the cake was very, very dry.",2.0
french fries look like seasoned fries but aren't.,2.0
some things like the bathrooms were spotless!!,2.0
i am not used to this tj food i guess... id go elsewhere.,2.0
also not enough ingredients compared to other places and no finishers.,2.0
the fries were just ok at best.,2.0
their beer cooler was also broken and they had only two beers on draft.,2.0
"rice and beans served warm not hot, three overcooked chicken legs no thighs.",2.0
gone is the wicked pizza replaced by dry overcooked prosciutto pizza.,2.0
the jambalaya was lacking any meat other then the over cooked mussels on top.,2.0
the toppings are bland and the chicken made me nauseous.,2.0
will be going elsewhere from now on.,2.0
"instead of a long drawn out review, let's keep it pithy.",2.0
"the food was ok, but i ordered chicken gyros and was given lamb gyros instead.",2.0
"i've been there twice now, and both experiences have been disappointing.",2.0
"unfortunately, we were disappointed with the quality and taste of the food.",2.0
don't pay extra for the reserved balcony seats.,2.0
it's really freaking frustrating.,2.0
"the pastrami, steak and turkey are plentiful, but flavorless.",2.0
the hotel is old and appears to be converted from another chain.,2.0
after finishing our salads we asked when the pizza would be out.,2.0
just seems like grumpy minimum wagers.,2.0
the buns were soggy from the condiments and assembled half heartedly.,2.0
"anyway, i seemed to have more fun at the other clubs.",2.0
"very plain tacos, not a lot of a flavor.",2.0
probably won't come back here again.,2.0
the service at the cutting tables was so slow!,2.0
gave us a complimentary dessert but didn't make up for the disappointing meal.,2.0
the service is absolutely horrible and the food is very hit or miss.,2.0
our experience was definitely not like others.,2.0
"as much as it filled my need for a transfer, it did only that.",2.0
very limited... won't be back...,2.0
the room itself wasn't poorly furnished or anything.,2.0

the side of fries came out cold.,2.0
steak is very bland.,2.0
the doors were both open making the already cold night colder.,2.0
super slow and poor service...,2.0

i've had grocery store sushi that has tasted better.,2.0
expensive food for not much return on the tastebud meter.,2.0
compete lack of support and instructions provide.,2.0
at least my feet didn't stick to the floor in the theater.,2.0
i wasn't impressed with the wings.,2.0
not pleasant for enjoying a glass of wine.,2.0
"on my last visit,  i could barely eat it.",2.0
my filet was terribly salty and undercooked.,2.0

so sad my favorite place has declined so much in the past few years.,2.0
the cheese crisp had hardly any cheese on it!,2.0
the restaurant is so tiny too many tables.,2.0
las vegas cuisine has gone down hill in the last years.,2.0
"the food was good, which is why it's getting any stars.",2.0
maybe you train your staff better!,2.0
not the greatest place on the planet.,2.0
i stalled before ordering and asked my firned what she was getting.,2.0
"well, what a disappointment...",2.0
you may want to go elsewhere for your flooring needs.,2.0
first thing i got to say is that servies is not that great.,2.0
"but, every time i go back, i feel like i'm a glutton for punishment.",2.0
look cirque du soliel.,2.0
most servers make conversation with guests but she did not conversate with us.,2.0
the mushroom swiss burger was very dry and lacked in any real flavor.,2.0
with two order my sandwiches weren't freaky fast actually freaky slow.,2.0
the broccolini was plain and the mash potato was just ok.,2.0
we probably won't be going back.,2.0
most recently they were leaving dirt right outside my front door.,2.0
"overall, i will not return unless they cut their price in half.",2.0
the service is not so great.,2.0
"however, my fiancé ordered the pulled pork platter which came out cold.",2.0
i wouldn't order either dish again.,2.0

it is really expensive and the help was less than average.,2.0
the food was a disappointment.,2.0
i wasn't a big fan.,2.0
the food and i mean the burger and fries come with extra grease.,2.0

this place is nothing more than a second rate cafeteria.,2.0
but don't count on good food.,2.0
if im paying extra i would expect better tasting food.,2.0
it was packed with people sitting there doing nothing.,2.0
coffee was ok but the amount of flies on their food is really off putting.,2.0
my manicure was mediocre,2.0
my experiences there were never bad until this time i had an awful server.,2.0
the claustrophobic atmosphere and pricey bad drinks don't do it for me.,2.0

dinner size salad was like a side salad.,2.0
never seemed to have competency other than to just give vaccinations.,2.0

went to dales pub and grub for lunch had the perch sandwich was not impressed.,2.0
"as i read the other reviews, i was expecting much less.",2.0

pink's was supposed to be a massive ending to a great drunken vegas night.,2.0
"i like the place, but with the poor soup quality.",2.0

and the crab puffs didn't really have any cream cheese or crab in them.,2.0
"the atmosphere was mixed, children playing along side adults.",2.0
the waitress was nice enough but the food was sub par at best.,2.0
seems way overpriced for the quality,2.0
my omelette was pretty good but the hash browns were awful!,2.0
"we probably will not return, i am disappointed as i had heard great things.",2.0
so maybe if you are a guy or shopping for one you'll have better luck.,2.0
"good if you need to not starve, but not ""good"".",2.0
"it's not me, it's you.",2.0
"well, that logic fell short.",2.0
or maybe this salon isn't for women of my age.,2.0
food and service has gone down hill.,2.0
mediocre visit at best.,2.0
the food has potential.,2.0
the price is dependent on what you add to the noodles.,2.0
i wouldn't recommend since i've heard there are so many other options in calgary.,2.0
we waited a long time between apps and our main dishes as well.,2.0
other than that the food isn't that great.,2.0
"although the flavors were savory, there was a lack of complexity.",2.0
or perhaps get a job that you actually like.,2.0
"i ordered pizza and wings, not wings with a cold pizza appetizer.",2.0
i can definitely say there more better restaurants in toronto.,2.0
the vip areas are lame.,2.0
besides presentation this was a lackluster meal.,2.0
we went to lunch with high hopes of some good southern bbq.,2.0
"when i got my phone back, the sides of my phone were severely scratched.",2.0

i think this place is totally overrated.,2.0
go try somewhere else for steak.,2.0
they were kinda bland and maybe could have used more sauce.,2.0
"lots of choices, but truly terrible food.",2.0
i could have gotten a bigger car for the same price elsewhere.,2.0
"wait, we were given a table on the second floor near the bar.",2.0
all the while i was without a home computer.,2.0
two stars if the recall work was really done.,2.0
there is something to be said about slapping your coffee in a huge styrofoam cup...,2.0
everything was extremely over priced for the quality i was getting.,2.0
hh wasn't enough to lure me into ordering dinner.,2.0
i won't go back to see how grooming services are.,2.0

others at our table had a similar experience.,2.0
"had a washington apple martini, too sweet, sent it back.",2.0
"cold beans, mushy rice, one large tomato chunk, store bought chips.",2.0
steamed egg was rubbery and the nouc cham wasn't as sweet as i'd have liked.,2.0
the focus here is so much on speed that preparation suffers.,2.0
i should know better!,2.0
"i agree with joanie h. good food, but long lines and grumpy employees.",2.0
food was mediocre at best.,2.0
can get a lot more high quality food for that price.,2.0

the quality of the food is always bland and the service seriously lacks.,2.0

"hard boiled egg appetizer, salty.",2.0
i would skip this starbucks on my next visit there.,2.0
it's been a week and my nails are a mess.,2.0
"not terrible, but not up to my standards.",2.0
you could find a better meal anywhere in the city.,2.0
there are holes all over the shelves there.,2.0
at least the collection is interesting and well labeled.,2.0
my main problem was the food.,2.0
the food was not that big of a deal.,2.0
it also didn't come with that much sauce.,2.0
we ordered a kids penne pasta it was hardly eaten.,2.0
"our waitress, who was clearly uninterested, said ""everything"".",2.0
the hashbrown that came with it was all soggy.,2.0
i hate to give this two stars.,2.0
even green tra ice cream tasted weired.,2.0
too expensive for the food they put out.,2.0
definitely not worth the price.,2.0
maybe it wasn't as good to me because i really wanted to try that chicken.,2.0
pasta sauce was nothing special.,2.0
the dessert was good but the person serving it was rude very unhappy and unfriendly.,2.0
not ethical in my books.,2.0
but something needs to be done.,2.0
"when it came time to reschedule for a follow up appointment, i was thoroughly disappointed.",2.0
"water pipes noisy high pitched in shower, sink faucet operational but broken.",2.0

"she was right, she was unprepared to come to work and it showed.",2.0
i really wanted to like this spot.,2.0
our waitress....this was another story.,2.0
that price is basically what i would pay at dillard's or tilly's.,2.0
the mediocre egg dishes could be easily prepared by the average cook at home.,2.0

indian is not so indian.,2.0

the hummus was very thin.,2.0
fast forward to today hmm...not so much.,2.0
the aroma of the beef is missing.,2.0
they only have one size and the broth wasn't that great.,2.0
not worth the money neither it's a friendly place.,2.0

but the combo appetizer was awful.,2.0
the flavors were very basic and not as enticing as they sound from their description.,2.0
the edamame arrived covered by a bowl but the bowl was dirty.,2.0
"this is all forgivable if the food has been outstanding, but it was not.",2.0

food was so so no better than a mcdonalds burger minus all the salt.,2.0
i've wanted to this forever and was so excited.,2.0
"the ambiance is totally lacking, yellow walls with bright pink molding.",2.0
the communication between the two is noticeably weak.,2.0
"the xiao long bao were over cooked, so much so there wasn't any soup inside.",2.0

food looks like a bland mix of korean and japanese.,2.0
"our entrees were nothing special, tasty but not impressed.",2.0

maybe the manager needs to check the cleanliness of his employees.,2.0
expected way better !,2.0
patio furniture had paint on it.,2.0
the place was packed and they looked pissed off and uncomfortable because of the crowd.,2.0
it just wasn't comfortable.,2.0

relentless loud electronica music was obnoxiously incongruent with the chill setting.,2.0
there were only a few other people in the restaurant.,2.0

we had mediocre service a year ago and wanted to give them another try.,2.0
not terrible but not good at all.,2.0
it was really windy one night and debris blew in under the door...lots of debris.,2.0

id choke on the beans if i didnt have a water bottle at the ready.,2.0
one of the lower quality denny's service isn't up to par.,2.0

the pesto sauce was flavorless and the service was absent.,2.0
"used to be better, shame but starbucks for me from now on.",2.0
this just isn't my type of place.,2.0

i just wouldn't do it the same way again.,2.0
food has gone way downhill.,2.0
i'm know there are better places in madison for breakfast than this place.,2.0
this place used to be really really really good.,2.0

games are over priced and half of them don't work.,2.0

"it was stuffed full of pork, but not much else.",2.0
the bubble tea wasn't that great either...,2.0
i made the mistake of ordering it with a poor substitute and the meal suffered.,2.0

the only good thing here i would say is the food.,2.0
the staffs in the front are not friendly.,2.0
i don't think they need any more business or something...,2.0

they should get better nicer people and update their menu.,2.0
"the service was nice and the place is colorful, but the food was terrible.",2.0
service was fine but the food was overpriced and not so good.,2.0
and that isn't what i got.,2.0
i ordered a bbq bacon cheesburger.,2.0
bagels were not doughy at all and very thin.,2.0
nothing special and it didn't look too clean either.,2.0

sandwich was supposed to be hot and had a cold sauce on top.,2.0
the final thing that got me was the flies.,2.0

no i am not on a low sodium diet nor did i expect hospital food.,2.0

food was fine but not worth the price.,2.0
i ordered delivery and i wasn't overly impressed.,2.0
got the prime rib and it was bland and unimaginative.,2.0
meh is all i can say about this place.,2.0
quality doesn't measure up to the cost.,2.0

the patty was a tad overcooked.,2.0
they seem stingy with the pickles.,2.0
the popcorn tastes like it has been sitting for a while.,2.0
the burger was really bland and over priced.,2.0
that's not the color they started out as.,2.0

the pittsburgh zoo is just not well kept.,2.0
don't envision going here again,2.0
my ramen tasted like the broth had something burned in it.,2.0
crust was tough and both pizzas were not cooked long enough.,2.0

"ordered pad thai and it wasn't very good, it didn't seem fresh.",2.0
inconsistent service and drinks.,2.0
"weird service, so so food and so loud you can't talk unless shouting.",2.0
i've had better and definitely made better at home.,2.0
"while the look is fine, there are several problems that made it unpleasant.",2.0
only reason this gets two stars is because our server was fast and great.,2.0
the only good thing is the sweet potato fries.,2.0
they used to be awesome.,2.0
i find the staff very cold and not that friendly.,2.0
"tuna wasn't fresh and was over cooked, shrimps were drowned and tiny!!",2.0
even the sushi was pretty limiting.,2.0
"foodwise, i left unsatisfied.",2.0
i would have rather eaten at the palms' food court.,2.0
the naan and rice portions were small for having so much sauce as well.,2.0
the food was bland.,2.0

slow service and mediocre food.,2.0

it came with fries which were lackluster and under seasoned.,2.0
would of had a better burger at in n out.,2.0
"the spinachi had ""garlic butter"" under the toppings.",2.0
the taters were overdone.,2.0
i don't think we need it to contain beets or whatnot.,2.0

the food was not slow or the wrong temperature.,2.0
"at those prices, you can buy something new, or go to goodwill instead.",2.0
"pour le reste, le riz est trop cuit et n'est vraiment pas bon.",2.0
the sushi tasted very bland.,2.0
don't think i would go back again as there are much better restaurants in vegas.,2.0
"the food was decent, however one of our plates was cold.",2.0
based on how long it took to renovate you would expect perfection.,2.0
"don't know her name, she never introduced herself, but was not very pleasant.",2.0
the food took a fairly long time to arrive.,2.0
the waitress was nice enough but service was very slow.,2.0
"didn't make it on a monday for prime rib night, shouldn't have came at all.",2.0
but everything seems to have gone by the waste side.,2.0
i was very dissappointed with that.,2.0
i expected food that was  prepared with more of a flare.,2.0
i'd probably give the place another shot.,2.0
"i've had lunch items which were decent, and some other fried rice which was terrible.",2.0
relatively disappointing as far as breweries go.,2.0
"it is disappointing that a meal that was so rushed, was served cold.",2.0
usually there's almost too much meat... so of course he's unhapppy.,2.0
i found this place overpriced for what you get.,2.0
the burgers needed seasoning and was not juicy.,2.0
service can be slow.,2.0
the wings were still hot and we couldn't eat.,2.0
only good thing about this place.,2.0
"the service was prompt and friendly, but the food was just average.",2.0
"no refills on coffee, and the food was nowhere as good as  previously.",2.0
way to expensive and  i've been forced to wait even after making  an appointment.,2.0
however there is no consitency with the rolls.,2.0
the service was underwhelming.,2.0
just because it's expensive doesn't mean that it taste better.,2.0
two things stood out to me about the service.,2.0
the employees are high school kids who could care less about the custo,2.0
"however, i was supremely disappointed.",2.0
"overall, will not eat there again.",2.0
definitely need a cashier and someone preparing ice cream separately.,2.0
bland mac and cheese in a faux cheese sauce.,2.0
she forgot to bring us extra dishes and napkins and disappeared for a long stretch.,2.0
"for studying, probably not.",2.0
"however, i would rather search out for more places.",2.0
"probably won't be back, but it may have just been a bad time.",2.0

employees could have been more professional as well.,2.0
i don't think i would order from there again.,2.0
my hubby's pork sandwich was equally uneventful.,2.0
tea cups had left over food on them.,2.0
"everything is over the top huge, and battered.",2.0
the remodel of the rooms looks like they went for the lowest bidder of contractors.,2.0
not a great expectation to start off with.,2.0
this did not help the location and decor.,2.0
btw the waiters dont know the difference between pea sprouts and alphalpha sprouts.,2.0
different leadership might go a really long way.,2.0
"until they revamp their menu with better cooks, would not come here again.",2.0
"currently they are a ""miss"" which is frustrating.",2.0
my problem was that the guy slicing the corned beef needs a lot of training.,2.0
either the syrup ran out or it's not calibrated correctly.,2.0
"however, the food and menu was a disappointment.",2.0
don't want to gamble on if breakfast will be good or not.,2.0
the shrimp tasted ok but they were overshadowed by the avoidable flaws.,2.0

i've used them two times.,2.0
the coffee was cold and clearly leftover from breakfast.,2.0
i don't think i'll be back,2.0
"would give the place another try, but definitely would t order this!",2.0
better off going to chain steakhouse.,2.0
and the tea is mediocre.,2.0
she also kept adjusting our heat to cook the meat which was very annoying.,2.0
this place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the midwest.,2.0
the pita bread seemed to be old and smelled funky.,2.0
the dishes arrived separately for each guest at the table.,2.0
ordered the elote dip and was not impressed.,2.0
i should have ordered the beet salad as my friend did.,2.0

but don't go for the food.,2.0
we had one server who was really attentive and the rest were mediocre at best.,2.0
i thought it was really dry.,2.0
we had to wait a long time for our drinks and our food and check.,2.0
meat was ok. sides weren't.,2.0
wings are huge but overcooked.,2.0
that's a pretty basic cooking flaw.,2.0
when we did receive our dinners one of them was wrong.,2.0
"it was not good, but was sustenance so it did its most base of jobs.",2.0
the full rack of st. louis ribs was a fairly meager portion for the price.,2.0

the table bobbled all over the place.,2.0
there is no way that many people are in the park.,2.0
they are extremely understaffed.,2.0
"next time, i think i'll only come back for those....",2.0
lady taking orders was not pleasant.,2.0
"don't get me wrong, it's not horrible... it's just not what it used to be.",2.0
they did nothing about it when we were there.,2.0
we had high hopes but we're disappointed.,2.0
if you're used to good thai food this is below average.,2.0
"two stars for screen and seats, but the service here is terrible.",2.0
"it was over done, not tender and no flavor.",2.0
the rooms reeked of smoke as did the entire casino.,2.0
my money is more useful elsewhere...and by the way the restaurant was empty,2.0

we will not be going back much better thai restaurants in vegas.,2.0
the room we stayed in was not very clean.,2.0
my cocktail had to be sent back due to lack of alcohol.,2.0

"oh well, we probably would think twice about returning because of this.",2.0
"maybe they do, maybe they don't.",2.0
"this place may be fine for trims and kids, but it's certainly no ""salon.""",2.0
ugh the employees in this store don't seem to care .,2.0
slightly over priced for the quality of flavors.,2.0
the only thing that was actually really good was surprisingly the corn.,2.0
first time at this location was pretty bad for several reasons.,2.0
"the third issue, they overlooked giving us a rx my husband needed for his surgery.",2.0
i came here based on the good ratings and it was just average at best.,2.0
i ordered the cheddar bacon burger.... it was like a hocky puck.,2.0
they may do a great job but i have never been able to find out.,2.0
"i asked for extra nutella, but first the waitress brought sprinkles.",2.0
plus they no longer provide toast with it anymore.,2.0
this place wasn't somewhere to rant about or even think about going back.,2.0
"for the price, skip it.",2.0
"lacked flavor and the ""gravy"" was all ketchup...eh.",2.0
"although staff are great,  this place is not fit to be a fitness club.",2.0
"sadly though, the food simply didn't deliver.",2.0
i felt dizzy and just kind of out of it and needed to eat.,2.0

i also didn't feel particulary at ease or well trained to use my weapon.,2.0
i won't be in any hurry to go back.,2.0
i didn't get a satisfactory answer.,2.0
the fruits weren't very fresh either.,2.0

over hyped and overpriced.,2.0
"was a lot better a few years ago, selection is too limited now.",2.0
most grocery store bottled sauces would have been an improvement.,2.0
"sorry for the poor review, i expected so much more.",2.0

and wait some more.,2.0
"the crust was soggy and doughy, i ended up only eating the toppings.",2.0
i will be going else where.,2.0
pizza was decent but the restaurant itself is disappointing.,2.0
i've had much better and cheaper hot dogs at the stands outside of baseball stadiums.,2.0
the decor of the place is pretty tacky.,2.0
spinach pie was more like an appetizer rather a main course option.,2.0
because their prices are low they get an extra star.,2.0
only thing that was right about my order was the sweet potato fries.,2.0
i hate to be the one person who wasn't impressed.,2.0
we came here for lunch and we were disappointed by the food and the service.,2.0

nothing like really good greek food.,2.0
"so, i stuck with water.",2.0
served sub par food my friend got his wings when i was done eating!,2.0
the room i stayed in had definitely seen better days.,2.0
there are better alternatives in the area that i would recommend over pickle barrel though.,2.0
they need to clean.,2.0
the amc esplanade offers neither when it comes to food at least.,2.0
honestly is rather just go to build a bear.,2.0
"none of traditional sushi rolls like green dragon, spider, california weren't available.",2.0
when requesting the pouring out of the coffee i was greeted with a frown.,2.0
was there yesterday and my lobster was totally over cooked.,2.0
service was quick and friendly but what they served was awful .,2.0
only two stars cause kids eat free.,2.0
the fries was soggy and the beef looked fake on the sandwich ..,2.0
"the rooms were nicely decorated once, but they're not kept up.",2.0
not well thought out.,2.0
they owe us more because they should know better.,2.0
and then they work slower than molasses flowing uphill.,2.0
a ton of other restaurants out there that are way better!,2.0
the lady was unhelpful and seemed annoyed by all my questions i was asking her.,2.0
"if i took my brother there, he would have to order two meals.",2.0
so might be the reason for the bad service.,2.0
way overpriced now and overhyped i am sad to say.,2.0
had the music blaring at concert level.,2.0
but the food we ordered was bland.,2.0
"the sandwiches were light on meat, light on flavor and the bread was all wrong.",2.0
the burger came  with a bacon sauce.,2.0
and wife and i found leftover food on our utensils.,2.0
barely any red flakes or peppers.,2.0

cheese selection is far inferior to that of heinen's and earth fare.,2.0
"if you are going to indulge in the calories, fries should be hot and crisp.",2.0
not everything is cookie cutter.,2.0
do not expect too much for the price.,2.0
i would say it is overpriced for the food and the service you received.,2.0
took forever to get anything from the waitress.,2.0
the food was warm but not hot.,2.0
the fried green tomatoes were soggy and bland.,2.0
i've been a few times now and i really don't get the appeal.,2.0
"this evening, i experienced a less than average dinner at bier markt.",2.0
i probably won't call here again.,2.0
there is entirely too much rice used in their sushi rolls!,2.0
i also couldn't tell if it had been fried or not.,2.0
i used to love their food.,2.0
i wouldn't go back.,2.0
food didn't seem to know what it wanted to be.,2.0
really it was mainly the noodle being the biggest let down.,2.0
they don't have much.,2.0
the food wasn't as hot as it should have been coming out of the kitchen.,2.0
the breadcrumbs were completely white !!!!,2.0
the sauces just weren't very flavorful.,2.0
place is the epitome of you get what you pay for.,2.0
we did not wait around to order dessert.,2.0
i probably won't be back.,2.0
you need better bartenders and djs!,2.0
waited a long time to order but waited forever to get our food.,2.0
the scone toppings were also problematic.,2.0
people with shopping carts basically block the entire aisle.,2.0
this is likely my last visit.,2.0
curly fries were also cold and soggy.,2.0
"very dated, small bathroom, tube tvbreakfast was good.",2.0
no ambience and unfriendly.,2.0
"overall, i'm not impressed with this place.",2.0
definitely not fresh cut fries.,2.0
it was kinda almost like the same texture of a cake pop but more dry.,2.0
so sad for ogden i expected more.,2.0
they also forgot the extra egg i ordered.,2.0
that was way too long to stand.,2.0
for now i guess i'll just stop going.,2.0
seems to be a magnet for guys who wear sleevleless shirts with giant arm holes.,2.0
there is also a frustrating lack of power outlets in the room.,2.0
the egg roll was really flavorless and kinda greasy.,2.0
"great drinks, horrible service.",2.0
staff used to be overly friendly and accommodating and now they are pretty rude.,2.0
they didn't bother to look at the ac unit which was part if the groupon.,2.0
i'll stick with safeway!,2.0
the place in general was just lacking in character and charm.,2.0
kind of ridiculous tbh.,2.0
"i know they saw me there, so it was really annoying.",2.0
not an appropriate place for the business traveler.,2.0
both were small portion sizes for the cost.,2.0
another few times the service is quite lacking.,2.0
the headboards had a thick layer of dust.,2.0
i'd rather pay a little extra not have to encounter this type of service again.,2.0
the table we did sit down at wasn't fully wiped off.,2.0
pizza is far from great.,2.0
"glad we tried it, won't go back",2.0
"the service was acceptable, but not particularly welcoming or informative.",2.0
we didn't care for greektown.,2.0
overpriced for fish and chips.,2.0
i don't think i feel comfortable visiting this location again.,2.0
nothing special and the boiled ones didn't seem fully cooked.,2.0
"the ""lobby"" is just gray floors and white walls, empty.",2.0
"over priced, overly loud, and the product does not match the scene.",2.0
i try to avoid coming to this mall as much as possible.,2.0
the bathrooms are dirty.,2.0
i can do without the automated paying station... that just slows down the line.,2.0
yeah....i'm not so sure about this place.,2.0
"the food was overpriced and like i said, mostly from the grocery store.",2.0
very sub par experience.,2.0
there was too much bread on the sandwich.,2.0
"fairly  nice  atmosphere , but  after  a few  visits,  we  would  never  go  there  again.",2.0
they are set much too high given the quality of the food.,2.0
"some of their restaurants are clean and well run, some are not.",2.0
the rice is dry and lacks flavor.,2.0
not worth the wait outside in the cold.,2.0
i was very disappointed in the service in particular.,2.0
tried a number of the skewers and nothing was great.,2.0
the crowd was sketchy.,2.0
the food is average and i'd rather just cook my eggs and toast at home.,2.0
i guess when it's busy quality of product no longer applies.,2.0
"however, they are sooooo slow and often forget things.",2.0
i hope things change for the better because i don't want to experience this anymore.,2.0
the service was soo slow.,2.0
even some msg would have been nice.,2.0
they're margaritas are weak and watered down .,2.0
chipotle isnt cheap for that they provide.,2.0
it wasn't worth it.,2.0
"the beef brisket sandwich was generous in proportion, but relatively flavorless.",2.0
the salad was bland and looked like it had been tossed together using old ingredients.,2.0
it seems like they have gone to lower quality food.,2.0
"if you are a male with a group of guys, this won't work well.",2.0
we just don't feel the value.,2.0
the food just wasn't up to par for me.,2.0
at least service was quick.,2.0
the bus boy was more present than our waiter.,2.0
rice was dry and hard from sitting for awhile.,2.0
"we made one complaint, and the waitress assured us that they were ""cooked.""",2.0

definitely not the best vietnamese.,2.0
the down side was the prices.,2.0

then of course there was the entire language barrier of fairly understanding or speaking english.,2.0
mike said cheapest isn't always best.,2.0
it was delivered in a 'gravy boat.',2.0
when i got my coffee i had to ask twice for milk.,2.0
not worth the price to get gels at your salon.,2.0
i really think you are better off with a massage in the canal shops.,2.0
"as a result, they had a very odd taste to them.",2.0
i really thought this place would be better then what we experienced.,2.0

the bread was cold.,2.0
processed ingredients with a dismal side salad.,2.0

my son's pancakes were supposed to have chocolate chips.,2.0
their assurredness of a superior product should then be backed up with superior customer service.,2.0

sorry to say but my experience wasn't the greatest.,2.0

had the blt and the cheese was weird and warm.,2.0
it is also a bit over priced.,2.0
the system needs to change.,2.0
not sure why it took so long for cold spaghetti.,2.0
first time was terrible.,2.0
"it was red, not pink.",2.0
the food was just 'meh'...nothing worth writing home about.,2.0
"the space is ok and so is the service, but not the food.",2.0
"yup, they messed up my online order.",2.0
food was okay but overpriced.,2.0
unfortunately the food is average at best service is not good.,2.0
i just don't understand it anymore ... people seem to have lowered their standards .,2.0
"our waiter was great, but the food was overpriced for what i got.",2.0
"the reaction was mostly, 'we'll take care of it'... that's fine.",2.0
i wouldn't recommend the pasta or tiramisu.,2.0
"this rating isn't on product, but rather the redesign of seating and interior.",2.0
gym is too warm and lightly equipped.,2.0
i don't care if they give me free lunch or not.,2.0
tasted very similar to domino's.,2.0
my omelette looked more like scrambled eggs sitting in melted butter.,2.0
"way too dark, way too loud.",2.0
you used to get way more food for your money here.,2.0
"after our orders were served, they were scarce.",2.0
plain oatmeal has more flavor than their risotto... their steak is just as bad.,2.0
they werent as hot as i hoped they would be.,2.0
the food is ok but pricey considering what you get.,2.0
we just got breakfast burritos and the potatoes weren't fully cooked.,2.0
because he or she isn't very good at managing restaurants.,2.0
the food is not good enough to forgive that.,2.0
it's overpriced and definitely doesn't worth you an evening.,2.0
great value but nasty casino employees.,2.0
i don't think i'll be going back.,2.0
the patty melt was a big hunk 'o' burger on greasy rye bread.,2.0
"the hashbrowns were not good, really slimy and squishy on the inside.",2.0
room was dingy and all smoking rooms were under construction.,2.0
there were also lots and lots of flies in the back near the washrooms.,2.0
chicken club was good but coleslaw was awful.,2.0
"next, the drinks are overly expensive and ""meh.""",2.0
not the first time we've experienced this.,2.0
service was strangely slower for us.,2.0
i'm giving them two stars because the actual shaved snow i got was weirdly gross.,2.0
much better sushi elsewhere.,2.0
"however, it then took somewhere on the order of an hour to receive our food.",2.0
too many inconsistencies here.,2.0
this business is not worth the visit and the service.,2.0
not worth the price.,2.0
this location is very inconsistent.,2.0
although my bill would be significantly different.,2.0
my few hours here was probably the most bored i've ever been while drinking alcohol.,2.0
"when the description includes ""bubbling gruyere"" you expect the cheese to be hot, and melted.",2.0
the chicken bao was dry.,2.0
pineapples were not fresh on tacos.,2.0
the eggs benedict was poor at best.,2.0
for starters the music they play is just not right.,2.0
the albacore didn't seem to be the best cut.,2.0
lots of food varieties cooked to mediocrity.,2.0
"we wanted to try it, but will probably not be back.",2.0
"like others, i had high hopes for this place.",2.0
we have eaten at el burro on multiple occasions and always feel unsatisfied.,2.0
well the meat was not that good so not a big deal.,2.0
"prix vs la qualité, portion et service décevant.",2.0
"second, my husband ordered slippers.",2.0
broth lacks depth and overall flavour.,2.0
but the two stars because of how long the wait is for the elevator.,2.0
i also do not like the new changes to the place as well.,2.0
tinkerbell at superstition mall is way more customer and budget friendly.,2.0
the crust was not like usual and to much sauce.,2.0
antenna not reinstalled vacuuming was poor too.,2.0
even sbarro's would have been more desirable.,2.0
the food here has been getting worse for some time.,2.0
no presentation the stuff is just stacked on shelves.,2.0
they did have very nice employees and at least they weren't cheap on the toppings.,2.0
the whole experience did not live up to the hype.,2.0
used to be great fast service but not today.,2.0
not enough screens and too much banter,2.0
ordered pizza with buffalo swirl topping and they forgot it...lame.,2.0
the beer was not well chilled.,2.0
i also found it to be pricey for a booth tan.,2.0
it was lacking and not satisfying.,2.0
"tables are packed way too close together, no privacy and not much space between tables.",2.0
you're better off going to the market and buying some fish sticks.,2.0
lobby is cramped and uninviting.,2.0
the problem really was the dishes were all too salty.,2.0
all that until we were ready to checkout.,2.0
"the edamame were served warmish, and tasted just like they do everywhere else.",2.0
"meat was tough, flavor was simple.",2.0
turkey was fairly tasteless and dry.,2.0
"once cooked in the hot pot, the beef are not tender but rough.",2.0
and i haven't been impressed with the service.,2.0
when they arrived we were less than impressed.,2.0
their workers kind of seem oblivious to getting hot food out quickly.,2.0
"the service was nice, but the food is sooooo overrated.",2.0
as it was it wasn't worth what we did pay either.,2.0
i'm used to friendlier quilt shops for sure.,2.0
people that go through a drive thru expected to be quick.,2.0
it's not what i called bbq.,2.0
i've had orders screwed up here almost every time i ordered.,2.0
let me tell you it's gone downhill.,2.0
took our food orders before drinks even came out.,2.0
the food are lacking of flavour and it was expensive too!,2.0
the new york was tough all throughout the cut and full of veins.,2.0
bathroom door is so close to the open bread area.,2.0
"the waitress, on her first rerun asked how everything tasted t",2.0
the chicken was also dry.,2.0
the toppings look shriveled and gray.,2.0
the decorations are quite tacky and the whole place lacks ambiance.,2.0

that will be the only reason i return.,2.0
overall the food was edible.,2.0
the pork belly noodles were awful.,2.0
"uneven service, tuna entree served cold, then taken back to warm and then returned overcooked.",2.0
my husband bbq tasted like lighter fluid.,2.0
the menus and the tables are sticky.,2.0
there were also a lot of fruit flies hovering around the charcuterie board and fruits.,2.0
"our waitress was really bad as well, so that didn't help.",2.0
it was also pretty dry and tough so that made it hard to eat.,2.0
"worn out too, our booths were badly ripped and saggy.",2.0
"anyways, onto the food.",2.0
went for lunch today and was really disappointed.,2.0
"the menu is huge and extensive, but nothing is really done that well.",2.0
this felt more like an expensive basic wash.,2.0
"second, the fish taco was not served how it was stated on the menu.",2.0
i don't see what the big deal is about this place.,2.0
i don't think i saw one employee that looked remotely happy to help with anything.,2.0
the place is definitely meh.,2.0
common logic would dictate that the guacamole would be cheaper in phoenix than beverly hills.,2.0
a first cup of coffee was difficult to obtain as were refills.,2.0
other arahovas were better.,2.0
i would say this texas roadhouse isn't like the others.,2.0
my homies got two lap dances and they were not cute.,2.0
i was not impressed.,2.0
"def not worth the wait, energy and money.",2.0
the pie was average at best.,2.0
i should've just watched the games at the sports book in a casino.,2.0
"the service was good, but not good enough to want to come back.",2.0
"also, the front gate is extremely annoying.",2.0
"for the price, you're honestly getting a better value at subway.",2.0
i've honestly had way better cupcakes from a grocery chain than this place.,2.0
maybe it was just our night... pricey for the outcome.,2.0
customer service here sucks.,2.0
i may give it one more chance.,2.0
not something you want to hear as you're getting your breakfast.,2.0
"but after an hour and no food, things went down hill quickly.",2.0
the fish i had was very fishy and the sides were over salted.,2.0
"if you like your nails neat, go somewhere else.",2.0
hopefully that was just a coincidence and not indicative of how they treat female clients.,2.0
first visit and probably my last.,2.0
i am pretty sure my waitress was more concerned about socializing than doing her job.,2.0
reprimanded us for using napkins for our water glasses when she wanted them for drinks.,2.0
she just seemed very tired.,2.0
after reading all the rave reviews i was really disappointed.,2.0
but i couldn't enjoy it.,2.0
staff was very good but the food was terrible.,2.0
don't fancy the coffee quality at all.,2.0
that's about the only thing going for it.,2.0
"the kitchen was slow, really slow.",2.0
also the take out system seems disorganized.,2.0
it seemed as though everything was overly salted instead of properly seasoned.,2.0
this airport is much too crowded to have these things.,2.0
as i said the best thing about this place was the waitresses.,2.0
most likely will not go back.,2.0
but that's not the case here either.,2.0
the espresso are...eh... and the pizzas are pretty greasy.,2.0
i think this place has a lot of potential but unfortunately just falls short.,2.0
there are better places than to eat.,2.0
the kind of treatment we received was inexcusable regardless of the popularity of food served.,2.0
i had to pick out the pieces so i could justify finishing it up.,2.0
limited flavors at this location.,2.0
the only good about this bar is the fact that they have alcohol.,2.0
i don't like these kinds of surprises.,2.0
i didn't smell any wood smoke inside or outside.,2.0
"lose the slutty waitress outfits, the bad music, and cozy the place up.",2.0
the sears wing is completely dark.,2.0
we ordered a couple of types of burger and a plate of mussels.,2.0
the meat had no flavor and my enchiladas were cold.,2.0
and the employees grumbled while making the tacos.,2.0
"the portions are pretty small, and sauces are bland.",2.0
things get broken and never fixed.,2.0
having a raw tuna soaked sandwich is not the most appealing thing.,2.0
"for the price, i'd rather go to sonoma grill downtown.",2.0
or maybe i ordered incorrectly....,2.0
the set up for ordering makes no sense.,2.0
people don't come to sapporo for the food though.,2.0
drove here to be disappointed by the low quality of the food.,2.0
the bread on the sandwiches were dry and crumbly.,2.0
"wasn't impressed much for the food menu items ...large wine selections and beers...neighborhood bar,  upscale.",2.0
not a particularly great experience.,2.0
i expected better food.,2.0

came here for dinner with colleagues and us rather unimpressed.,2.0
service was fast and prices are average but the quality was low.,2.0
"i tried to part them the other way, but that looks more ridiculous.",2.0
water was brought and menus were left at our table.,2.0
it was a mess.,2.0
they didnt want to hear me.,2.0
food is good but will not be going back.,2.0
"this day and age in lv, not so much.",2.0
it kind of reminds me of an old elementary school cafeteria.,2.0
"so i'm not so sure what to believe, but i'll be visiting someone else.",2.0
i have had better.,2.0
service was very slow.,2.0
definitely prefer island flavor restaurant for hawaiian food instead but too bad it's too far.,2.0
"service is extremely slow, even when there are hardly any patrons.",2.0
"maybe it was because it was late, or it just wasn't a good night.",2.0
"really, look elsewhere for lunch or dinner.",2.0
exercise gear that is broken for days.,2.0
the maple dip didn't taste like maple.,2.0
the staff is inconsistent.,2.0
ordered the chicken extra spicy was not hot at all.,2.0
"on the other hand, the service was horrible.",2.0
it's like they didn't know how to manage with a full house.,2.0
this will probably be the last time we order.,2.0
lots of msg left me very thirsty and they were very light on the meat.,2.0
much better restaurants in the area.,2.0
no concept of flavor.,2.0
someone there needs to jump on inventory control... asap!,2.0
"in their defense they are very busy, but the service is terrible.",2.0
we weren't the only ones with cold food.,2.0
we were almost done before it was brought to our table.,2.0
the shrimp in the shrimp and eggs weren't seasoned.,2.0
probably won't be going back.,2.0

the bill wasn't pleasant either.,2.0
"i ordered a smoothie, but changed my mind on the spot before i even paid.",2.0
the noise level was enough to want to get up and walk out!,2.0
if you want authentic indian food go somewhere else.,2.0
if it's gonna be soggy because of the gravy then the gravy should be decent,2.0
i've had better salmon for half the price!!,2.0
overall nothing to write home about.,2.0
we ordered chicken seekh kabob and they were overcooked.,2.0
for my first trip to a vegas buffet i expected more.,2.0
maybe back in the day it was something more but not now.,2.0
lots of construction going on so maybe it's going to get better.,2.0
"the server said they found a few more ribs, really.",2.0
the noodle is not good quality ramen.,2.0
and don't depend on their white wine list.,2.0
"however, service really detracted from experience and subpar to say the least.",2.0
so the gluten free option is really not available.,2.0
"i would give avalon one star but, it is very organized and clean.",2.0
this place needs a bit of work.,2.0
two different items both had hair on them,2.0

there was a weird watery yellow film over it all.,2.0
"food fine, service terrible.",2.0
my family members had the same issues with top golfs food.,2.0
it needs renovations and a better cleaning crew.,2.0
not many good choices for chinese food in the immediate area unfortunately.,2.0
but the service and food is suspect and inconsistent to say the least.,2.0
my husband's chicken marsala was also unremarkable.,2.0
"i've had better, but this was certainly passable.",2.0
i probably will not go back.,2.0
"also, don't order an egg sandwich unless you like your eggs very, very runny.",2.0
the burger was really dry and did not taste like normal in and out.,2.0

the lobby is so noisy i cannot hear what theteller is saying.,2.0
fish and chips are very salty.,2.0
tomatoes in caprese salad were pale and not flavorful.,2.0

"value, service, quality, choices, atmosphere... meh.",2.0

not enough options on their menu.,2.0
the waitress did not know which seasonal vegetables were included.,2.0
"it's either a one or a two, i'll be generous and give it a two.",2.0

it was an honest error.,2.0
avocado toast was nothing special.,2.0
"when they finally corrected and got our food, it was below average.",2.0

i don't like the topping and the crust.,2.0
it was below average but not neccessarily bad.,2.0
they charge extra for removing toppings!,2.0
"the burrito was marginal, even for a bar.",2.0
the crust was dry and burnt.,2.0
none of the five in our party felt that they had anything special.,2.0
i'm not planning to go back.,2.0
the food is so so and the prices are ridiculously high.,2.0

"i had fajitas, and applebee's produces a better product.",2.0
"wtf, got less, charged more.",2.0
"similar disappointment on flavour, crust.",2.0
this time it was bland only two pieces and was very disappointed.,2.0
the pho broth lacked depth and the rice noodles were heavy and starchy.,2.0

could use better customer care.,2.0
"if the food wasn't priced so high, i would've enjoyed myself more.",2.0
okay last bit of beef...,2.0
the veal parmesan was mediocre at best the breading was mushy and fell off.,2.0
it's most likely due to the store manager not setting a good example.,2.0
also the fries were floppy and barely brown which is not my cup of tea.,2.0
eh not much to write home about.,2.0
"well, maybe one bit of cucumber.",2.0
the restaurant is in an old house or what looks like an old house.,2.0

for now i'm going to stick with their other locations.,2.0
price is lower but i wouldn't come back.,2.0
"we were never offered refills on drinks, fries, root beer floats.",2.0
it's whether care or don't.,2.0
subway clone but not as efficient.,2.0
the reason i gave two stars is that the server did a fine job.,2.0
not sure what that meant.,2.0
service wasn't impressive either.,2.0
"our first waitress was not very pleasant so they sent us a new,  friendlier waiter.",2.0

china grill is a very run of the mill 'westernized' chinese restaurant.,2.0
"not to mention she made the acrylics wayyyyy too thick, so they look extremely fake.",2.0
their shopping carts are all rusty and broken.,2.0
the wait time is long but not because they are so busy.,2.0
but service was more like a d class restaurant.,2.0
"the lemon lime beet sorbet was interesting, just not my thing.",2.0
i don't think i'll be finding my way back here for sushi any time soon.,2.0
they only offered butter chicken or chili chicken as the protein option.,2.0
the service was surly.,2.0

"or, maybe this town just needs a new restaurant.",2.0
it takes forever to get to you.,2.0

if i want a drink i will order one,2.0
but the tacos we didn't even finish it.,2.0
fish and chips were very brown like oil hadn't been changed in awhile.,2.0

i hate the thousand island taste of their spread and they do not have mayo.,2.0
the fries included in the special were room temperature and clumped together.,2.0
we skipped dessert as we had eaten enough mediocre food.,2.0
but the food and service need much improvement.,2.0
it was dry and too light and frankly small for the price .,2.0
the sauce was like a soup.,2.0
kind of a bummer on top of everything else.,2.0
the place has such potential as it is a beautiful location.,2.0
it is drab and boring and therefore empty even during a cav's final.,2.0
but i was totally disappointed.,2.0
even the daily specials are predictable.,2.0
pity 'cause it would be great to have a breakfast place so close to home.,2.0
its kinda pricey for what you get.,2.0
was way too tiny and messy.,2.0
slightly worse than most.,2.0
it should have been called roast beef sandwhich with a dip.,2.0
very expensive and not worth the time going for.,2.0

the hay was wet and some of it molded.,2.0
i got the world's smallest tenders.,2.0
i really can't figure out why the price is so high.,2.0
service isn't the quickest.,2.0
"honestly, i do not smell any thing but possibly that's the problem.",2.0
we find the food overpriced and tasted mediocre.,2.0
i'll eat somewhere else before i come back here.,2.0
not the quality it used to be.,2.0
took the beer and refused the dessert.,2.0
i have actually had better at denny's.,2.0
made a mess of the baseboards.,2.0
very busy and staff was impolite.,2.0
had lunch and was quite disappointed.,2.0
just wasn't prepared for that level of dive.,2.0
lots of the no name machines were spread about which was a total bummer.,2.0

he has a dry sense of humor.,2.0
"other people's   opinions vary but in my opinion, the food was very dry.",2.0
i went for lunch and did not have an enjoyable experience.,2.0
je n'a pas essayé les sushis je ne peux donc commanter,2.0

"the parmesan fries tasted only like oil, no other flavour.",2.0
both of us though that we had eaten better.,2.0
and it wasn't even busy for hh on a monday yet nobody wanted to help.,2.0
not worth the price.,2.0
this seemed to be a trend in both dishes.,2.0
it's just starch on starch and makes the sandwich unnecessarily heavy.,2.0
the food was not up to par though.,2.0
didn't try the food.,2.0
the parfaits were mediocre.,2.0
the duck was too dry.,2.0
the creme brulee was too eggy.,2.0

"ceviche was basically guacamole, short ribs were tiny and nothing special.",2.0
the risotto was very watery and the steaks were very dry and bland.,2.0

"the mexican rice, on the other hand, somewhat lacked in flavour.",2.0
the table was dirty when we sat down.,2.0

they pre scoop and freeze their green tea ice cream in bowls.,2.0
"the experience was like, it was just another sushi place.",2.0
no return trip for us.,2.0
the restrooms are very odd.,2.0
would have cost the same and would have gotten more.,2.0
most everything is a few decades behind the times.,2.0
it's sadly a forgettable dining experience.,2.0
"if you expect anything other than applebee's, you will most likely be disappointed.",2.0
"over time, however, i've found that the quality of their food noticeably decreased.",2.0
but the prices are outrageous.,2.0

"the pizza was okay, and the service was lousy.",2.0
"the duck was nothing special, all bones no meat.",2.0

the garden salad was actually a lettuce salad with two tomatoes.,2.0
the waiter was very inattentive and the food took quite awhile to come out.,2.0

the menu is pretty lameski if you don't go in for a lot of meat.,2.0
unfortunately wouldn't come again due to price value comparison.,2.0
the rice wasn't good and the fish wasn't as fresh as it should be.,2.0
not worth the time or the money.,2.0
"if you are looking for serious heat, not the place.",2.0
was not impressed at the food nor the customer service.,2.0
customer service was abysmal.,2.0
kind of a let down.,2.0
also the price is expensive for the quality of the food.,2.0
i must say that each time the quality and service diminishes.,2.0
there are far better steakhouses in las vegas.,2.0
don't get the pangoa unless you're a big fan of rice drowned in bbq sauce.,2.0

"chili cheese is tastless, kraut dog was not very good.",2.0
last time i ate at this branch was a year ago and such a difference.,2.0
the turkey was ok but the brisket was just plain nasty.,2.0
there breakfast is over priced and the portions for a breakfast is to be desire.,2.0
i will not go out of my way across the city for that experience again.,2.0
speak loud enough so customers can here your questions and that would help better experience.,2.0
the quantity at om is pretty less compared to the amount paid.,2.0
someone could of easily taken our drink order!,2.0
the worst part is that the servings are too small.,2.0
you'd think they'd fix that.,2.0
i just can not get them to serve me the red potatoes and bacon hot.,2.0
warranty time limit expires but the mileage is not.,2.0
if one advertises menu items it needs to serve as depicted.,2.0
two stars because it's papa johns and the food is what it is.,2.0
when i got them back there face was still hairy and they looked patchy.,2.0
they miss things on your order have an attitude and take forever! !,2.0

they need to improve the food.,2.0
"however, the waitress forgot my order a couple times.",2.0
"however, they are really pushing meals.",2.0
"wouldn't come back, pastor has a good flavor but it is dry, hard, and cold.",2.0

cold taco stuffed with cheese and mystery meat.,2.0
they have stooped serving fruit pies with the exception of apple  several months ago.,2.0
i've had better steaks....,2.0
"all in all, it was disappointing.",2.0
they have much better food and prices.,2.0
the chicken salad wasn't appetizing at all.,2.0
wasn't worth the trouble to us.,2.0

will probably not go back since there are other options.,2.0
"although the cake is beautifully moist and soft, it has zero flavor.",2.0
"food very bland, you can do better.",2.0
they all seemed rather bored of just about everything and everybody.,2.0
i keep ordering various items and am always left unsatisfied.,2.0
"and i'm telling you, other than the thai corn chowder, this food was barely edible.",2.0
"second, the clotted cream was very sour, almost as if it was spoiled.",2.0
it's all downhill from here.,2.0
food is overpriced for what is offered.,2.0
prices are lower but would only recommend coming here if you have no other choice.,2.0
staff didn't seem to understand what they were doing or even care about it.,2.0
so i really can't see why it took so long.,2.0
"it was a bargain, but not something that i will go back for.",2.0
"i really wanted to like this place prior to going here however, i can't.",2.0
i'd expect this at a gas station...or college bar... but not here.,2.0
for just a patty with a few condiments.,2.0
not off to a great start.,2.0
"i rather liked the mango panna cotta, it tasted like a rich mango pudding.",2.0

i don't see what all the rave reviews are about.,2.0

"food was bland, uninspired and it wasnt cheap.",2.0
one of the most overrated steak houses i've ever been to.,2.0

i guess customers are not that important.,2.0
"too expensive, not worth to eat the roasted duck.",2.0
i've had better box sushi from the grocery store.,2.0
"the food was so ""blah"".",2.0
i was hoping the frozen hot chocolate would be really sweet and tasty.... nope.,2.0
then when received warm i could tell it was not fresh.,2.0
went on a friday evening and probably won't return.,2.0
"it didn't taste fresh, and the dumpling skin wasn't very soft.",2.0
but this place is something else.,2.0
waitresses were great but greeter was completely rude we debated on leaving because of it.,2.0
the service was friendly but really slow.,2.0
the only thing this place seems good for is watching sports and drinking.,2.0

"the ""large"" salad was not large.",2.0
"really, you could to better.",2.0
the yew pine was pruned so that it is lopsided.,2.0

it rarely makes a difference when a complaint is made these days.,2.0

the coconut shrimp tasted fishy.,2.0
ingredients and dough must have changed.,2.0
"all were decent, but the portions were small leaving us unsatisfied... particularly the cheese board.",2.0
they redid it but this time was way overcooked.,2.0

batter was falling apart and didn't taste or feel the 'cod' in the portion.,2.0
food was stacked over each other.,2.0
the pork was dry and got stuck in my teeth.,2.0
and the cake is on the dry side.,2.0

i've tried both locations.,2.0
j'ai regretté d'y être entré.,2.0
there was not enough ingredients to call it a full salad.,2.0

in my opinion the meat was on par with a cheap buffet.,2.0
overtime it's become less flavorful.,2.0

no one is in a rush to do anything around there.,2.0
both times the service was terrible and they seems to constantly be out of things.,2.0
the dish was more like a noodle soup than anything else.,2.0
there are so many places around dropout that provide better for the same price.,2.0
"eh, this place is not good.",2.0
i won't be back until they increase their staff with knowledgeable workers.,2.0
"the french fries were passable, actually good.",2.0
a lot of people i know have had the same experience.,2.0

i won't be rushing back there,2.0

menu is much smaller than previous owner.,2.0
meaning they should be cooking a certain amount to keep up with demand and speed.,2.0
they do have good lunch specials and again this chinese food wasn't very good.,2.0

the quality of the sushi was poor as it broke apart very easily.,2.0
i get the feeling they don't appreciate their customers.,2.0

i'd rather go to a red mango or pink berry.,2.0
"the food, well, it was really heavy.",2.0
"i understand the concept of fast food, but they are really getting sloppy.",2.0
front staff clearly needs better leadership.,2.0
i don't get it.,2.0
no appropriate seating for our family of five.,2.0
i'm unfortunately unimpressed with everything else.,2.0
this place has gone so down hill over the last couple years.,2.0
service was slow...like slooooooooow.,2.0
it is not the tender bbq that i'm used to.,2.0
they should at least include in the menu a choice of a traditional ramen.,2.0
"they tasted sort of ""old"" and dry.",2.0
"good food, bad service!",2.0
at least in lv the long lines are understandable.,2.0
this is so annoying...just take a moment to wipe the tables down please!,2.0
"pretty steep for a ""casual"" bar.",2.0
the pizzas my husband and i ordered were mediocre.,2.0
"the roll was soft and doughy, not a good softly crusted bun.",2.0

the crust was super crunchy i was hoping for doughy.,2.0
i am so disappointed with my drink.,2.0
at the seasoning station they were low on all.,2.0
we won't likely be back.,2.0
tasted like box cake.,2.0
food is not all thatthe meat kinda lacks taste .,2.0
nothing special about their food.,2.0
the fries didn't seem to be fully cooked either.,2.0
everything is overpriced and disorganized.,2.0
the food is taking waaaaay too long.,2.0
i got the feeling that a lot of the employees were on coke or meth.,2.0
"the last two times i've been here, some of the food items were cold.",2.0
i don't remember what we ordered but nothing spectacular tasting.,2.0
i wouldn't pick this as my first place in oakland to grab chinese food.,2.0
i can't help but assume her hands weren't clean when she worked on my dress.,2.0
"they're too busy laughing and playing around, they need to do their job!",2.0
our server didn't show much enthusiasm.,2.0
and there's really a dearth of good breakfast diners in the area.,2.0
i'm sure it wasn't a ribeye.,2.0
rather they're cheaping out by making a 'skimpy' product and still charging the regular price.,2.0
not one of my best experiences.,2.0
i do not really get this place.,2.0
sadly i expected a lot more for the location and prices.,2.0

"mixed together it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good.",2.0
"it's a clean, friendly place but i've had better pho in town.",2.0
the chips and salsa that get were sadly probably the high point of the meal.,2.0
"ordered fried chicken and portions were dry, hard and chewy!!!!",2.0
but they didn't do a great job cleaning.,2.0
the dust was very annoying and should be covered in gravel or watered down.,2.0
i wouldn't recommend the tacos since they tasted a bit dry.,2.0
food is okay however the reception lady is terrible.,2.0
two bad experiences and that was enough for me.,2.0
when he brought the appetizers he didn't bring small plates.,2.0
the niçoise salad seemed wilted and not fresh.,2.0
however i was not a huge fan of their food.,2.0
our overall dining experience was extremely disappointing.,2.0
"for the gourmet prices, i would expect a more gourmet product.",2.0
i just didn't think the food was all that wonderful.,2.0
i think the luxor is a very understated place.,2.0
i guess i'll just have to skip the popcorn.,2.0
my tomatoes went on my wife's burger while her onions went on mine.,2.0
"a few observations, wine prices were terribly exorbitant.",2.0
it was a last minute bikini shopping trip and needed something.,2.0
food was mediocre at best.,2.0
i would probably never go here again for sushi.,2.0
"the venue was basic, felt like a glorified high school gym in a tent.",2.0
the blackout curtains were also starting to let the light in.,2.0
been here since last september and yet no assigned parking.,2.0
i would rate the food as edible but not good.,2.0
most of the food was hovering around slightly above room temperature.,2.0
maybe that's because the kids were throwing food at each other.,2.0
used to come under previous ownership and wanted to try again... what a disappointment.,2.0
i do have to say the chicken was juicy but had no seasoning.,2.0
"truthfully, barely enough for a single.",2.0
extra side of chicken was over priced.,2.0
we felt like an inconvenience rather than a patron.,2.0
"two stars bc the staff was friendly, place was clean, low price.",2.0
then we noticed other tables received teapots after we were seated.,2.0
i had to go through grub hub to get ahold of them.,2.0
they don't have either of those.,2.0
"plus, stains showed up afterwards.",2.0
too bad...we used to enjoy it.,2.0
i had the pastrami and the flavor wasn't there.,2.0
the staff discord is almost embarrassing at times.,2.0
the refried beans as a side was the best part of our meal...,2.0
"server wasn't very attentive in general, we felt like they would've preferred we weren't there.",2.0
"while the meal was average, the cost was much too high for the quality.",2.0
not very impressed with the customer service i have received from prestine cleaners.,2.0
it use to be a good place but it started to go down fast!,2.0
i don't think this place is staffed appropriately.,2.0
only redeeming feature is that our servers was smoking hot!,2.0
the food is over priced.,2.0
don't get the salad.,2.0
"but overall, probably wouldn't come back.",2.0
we both ordered entrees that included soup or salad.,2.0

the hot tea was never refilled or served on time.,2.0
seafood section is so unappealing.,2.0
the chicken was boiled and dry.,2.0

the food however is not so great.,2.0
they did not check or replace the charcoal for the hookah only once.,2.0
the roast beef was bland and boring.,2.0
they have limited selections of meats.,2.0
"not meaty, and the sauce was neither tasty nor spicy.",2.0
dining here again at this point is debatable but unlikely.,2.0
the pizza was allright.,2.0
not a terrible experience but not a place worth returning to.,2.0
the price was slightly high for a slightly unmemorable meal.,2.0
food took forever to come out.,2.0
the inside of the tunnel was filthy.,2.0
"place is kind of dirty, too.",2.0
"other then that, it was not the best and i probably won't go back.",2.0
"i doubt i'll go back......by the way, my husbands hamburger was excellent he said.",2.0
"on top of that, my meal tasted sour.",2.0
i've given the pastas several chances and it's always bland and overcooked.,2.0
won't go to again.,2.0
i was a bit dissapointed.,2.0
working it out required lots of unnecessary back and forth which soured the stay.,2.0
i had high expectations for their pie and unfortunately they were not met.,2.0
this is place to come with a group otherwise expect to get no attention...,2.0
expensive gringo mexican food.,2.0
well jeez i'm sorry you have to cook more food....,2.0
good size portions but the food had no flavor.,2.0
its bland bland bland.,2.0
we didn't think the pork fried rice was anything but greasy and flavorless!,2.0
i wouldn't really recommend delivery.,2.0
i dont see myself coming back here.,2.0
customer service was dismal.,2.0
"these both came with salads, and a very small bit of dressing.",2.0
i guess they are short on staffs every day.,2.0
today was not so great.,2.0
no leniency was given.,2.0
"dear dunkin donuts,when someone orders ""coffee"", they want ""coffee.""",2.0
the only reason i'll maybe try it again is because it's in my area.,2.0
but i didn't get what i was looking for.,2.0
"although the girls are nice, the gels are a rip off and tools are unsanitized.",2.0
at least the bagels were good.,2.0
"the fuze tea, well, it was tasteless and probably just carmel coloring.",2.0
ordered some coffee while looking over the menu and it tasted like dish water.,2.0
tonight the portion was extra small and poorly served.,2.0
"if it weren't so convenient, i would certainly look for another  vet.",2.0
food was cold and the service was inattentive.,2.0
i also never got the lemon for my water.,2.0
"and no, they weren't busy.",2.0
maybe a chicken salad sandwich.,2.0
"also, it was served in a run of the mill diner coffee mug.",2.0
i just remember not wanting to come back.,2.0
i would consider this place below average sushi,2.0

"the flavor was off, hard to describe but it tasted weird.",2.0
nothing to really say that was memorable.,2.0
expensive and food is subpar.,2.0
"not much to offer, but plenty of attitude and seclusion.",2.0

also the chashu was majority all fat and very little meat.,2.0
not impressed what so ever.,2.0
the fish and shrimp we heavily over battered and under cooked leaving them mushy.,2.0
maybe a smile or two would be great.,2.0
it was a good sized portion but lacked flavor.,2.0
just because you work for frc doesn't mean you know what good food is.,2.0
it was not a nice way to spend a father's day.,2.0
"the service was rushed, hardly time to browse the unique menu.",2.0
"what we experienced, however, was one of the most boring shows we've ever seen.",2.0

"ordered the penne al pollo e pomodoro, didn't get bread until my food came out.",2.0
the server didn't inquire how anything was and generally seemed annoyed to be there.,2.0

honestly not sure what to say.,2.0
the place truly is overrated and like i said before lengthy wait times.,2.0
you've just experienced kid lee.,2.0
this will probably not be a place to take my kids to again.,2.0
probably not worth the hassle of actually getting seated.,2.0
"horrible service, food is ok, arrives most of the time cold.",2.0
or the hummus tasted weird.,2.0
significantly overpriced for poor quality food is a pretty good summary.,2.0
"before, there's hardly any scars or blotches on their cake.",2.0

my prawns were soggy and the rice was very salty.,2.0
the red enchilada sauce is peppery and pretty bad tasting.,2.0

the steak was nothing special just very spicy.,2.0
"all in all it was a disappointing meal, we will not be back.",2.0

i have had issues returning goods here and find the customer service hit and miss.,2.0
there are so many better options around.,2.0
the sauce on it was dry.,2.0
very salty and doctored with far too much onion and garlic.,2.0
try buonos much better.,2.0
the ambience or lack there of needs work maybe music wall art waitresses with personality...,2.0
another thing is that she doesn't give us enough silverware to eat with.,2.0
"ça fait la job, comme on dit.",2.0
charro beans were very mushy and overcooked and i always look forward to those.,2.0
"nothing specials, no extractions, just massage and cream.",2.0
there are plenty of local bakeries with much better bread.,2.0
the last couple of times were not good.,2.0
super nice people is why they get a second star.,2.0

but what disappointed is the food..,2.0
"overall, i would not return to nando's.",2.0
service was pretty crappy overall and ruined the experience for us.,2.0
only one thing i like about them was painting in another big room.,2.0
"they also made my home fries hash browns instead, which were underseasoned and undercooked .",2.0

there are too many other choices.,2.0
"although my experience wasn't terrible, i just don't feel the need to come back.",2.0
i hate giving bad reviews to places but this place was just so subpar.,2.0

ended up hurrying through heavy traffic.,2.0
the waiteress are prettier than the dancers.,2.0
"no drinks offered, i had to ask for water when my meal finally arrived.",2.0
they should nix the sushi and simply be a martini bar.,2.0
"and when i did get my sweet potato fries, they were not the full effort.",2.0
"i explained that i didn't care what the receipts said, i ordered chips.",2.0
"no  aioli, no pesto, nothing except plain mayo and basic mustard as choices.",2.0

"also, they forgot about our soups.",2.0
"my pork tenderloin was very, very dry.",2.0
this restaurant used to be good.,2.0

but that wasn't what i had here.,2.0
"two stars for a decent atmosphere and attentive servers, but seriously bartenders, learn your craft.",2.0
"while sitting and waiting, there was a rush of people who came in to order.",2.0
if it's a cold day sit in the inner portion of the restaurant.,2.0

and most of the servers forget orders.,2.0

not somewhere i'll be going again.,2.0
not so much here.,2.0
the only redeeming aspects are the price and quick turnaround.,2.0

we were to afraid to order anything more than burgers.,2.0
i ordered a chorizo taco which came with maybe a teaspoon of meat.,2.0
it was salty and underwhelming.,2.0
"what materialized, however, was a disappointment.",2.0

i got ants climbing a tree and i thought it was rather bland.,2.0
we weren't impressed with that and won't be back.,2.0
the platter stuff all tasted like it was really old and just reheated.,2.0

the  rolls with too much  sauce.,2.0
health department should be involved in mandating grocery stores to have power backup.,2.0
expensive and not that tasty.,2.0
the dough is missing some substance.,2.0

not sure how a smaller bed is an upgrade.,2.0
i did not receive that from those two gentlemen whose names i did not get.,2.0
"you're definitely paying for the gimmick here, much like eating at bubba gump.",2.0
not enough to share for sure.,2.0
they get two starts because the food was hot,2.0

too expensive for a marginal job.,2.0

"the clams and oysters on the seafood towers were gritty, and did not taste fresh.",2.0
just bland and boring.,2.0
very pushy sales girls!,2.0

consistency is an issue with the chipotle chain.,2.0
i didn't think this store was doing well enough to turn away business.,2.0
it's either overnight and super expensive or long slow no promised delivery time.,2.0
"way better options for seafood and ""pacific rim"" cuisine.",2.0

this was very hard to see.,2.0
i was obviously uncomfortable and so was my boyfriend.,2.0
the food was overpriced for the lack of quality and freshness.,2.0

this place is odd.,2.0
i would much rather go to subway.,2.0
late delivery and luke warm appetizer.,2.0
"first of all, they use way too much rice on their nigiris and rolls...",2.0

i don't know if it depends on who is cooking or what is happening.,2.0
we weren't impressed with the mozzarella sticks either.,2.0
"i really, really wanted to like this place.",2.0
with that being said my experience at bb was as follows.,2.0
"the salon wasn't very decorated, and i believe the salon chairs didn't work.",2.0
disappointing as the concept seemed unique.,2.0
i expected better from caesar's palace.,2.0

very loud and crowded atmosphere.,2.0
this place isn't it.,2.0
"the sushi was not good at all,  the rice was overcooked which was disappointing.",2.0
had a couple pretty bad experiences here for lunch with slow service and undercooked meat.,2.0
they need to reconfigure the restaurant into smaller sections and employ noise dampening measures.,2.0
it was the medium size cobbler and it appeared they stuffed in the the container.,2.0
i tried several different mixed drinks and they were never quite right.,2.0
"however, it does not have anything extra to make it stand out.",2.0
the food is not good and there is no ambiance.,2.0
the service was so slow and they weren't even busy we were there early evening.,2.0
you will soon realize that it not worth the value for money.,2.0

"the ""home fries"" were those frozen tater tot thingies.",2.0
great food awful service!,2.0
i guess i wouldn't go back.,2.0

the food was okay but far too artificially sweet for me.,2.0
we  could have gotten a better meal off a hotel buffet.,2.0
"previous to this most recent experience, i had eaten several times at tipsy cow.",2.0
seemed that no one knew the stock and many shelf spaces were empty.,2.0
basically a glorified all you can eat buffet.,2.0
this was probably a one time experience.,2.0
the only hotel in vegas that does this... im disappointed...,2.0
"quoi qu'on en dise, j'ai mangé un steak mal apprêté.",2.0

"compared to before, the dish has no flavour or taste.",2.0
this place has only been open months and its already going down hill.,2.0
the only roll that stood out to me was the snow white roll.,2.0

the issue was cleanliness and service.,2.0
spent very little time wiping the car down.,2.0
didn't remember our drink orders.,2.0
the coffee table hadn't been dusted for a long time.,2.0
in general i wasn't a fan of the whole experience!,2.0

but not for breakfast if you are hungry.,2.0

it was a large portion but lacked freshness.,2.0
the ingredients seemed cheap.,2.0
i don't feel like the food is even worth it anymore.,2.0

the food was the only good thing.,2.0

probably one of the most overrated sandwich joints out there.,2.0
the food was not very good.,2.0
ageism at its best.,2.0
service was exceptionally slow.,2.0
this looks like a temporary location because it has very few selection.,2.0

food was pretty much below average.,2.0
the food was also warm not hot and it did not taste fresh imo.,2.0

"however, the sushi rice was too soggy.",2.0
i've definitely had better.,2.0
"i was hot, hungry and grumpy... not a good combo.",2.0

quality is definitely dependent upon the flavor.,2.0
won't eat lunch here again.,2.0
the clam chowder hadn't been cooked enough.,2.0
the only good part of our meal was daniel the busser .,2.0
i still need to go to la to have a decent ramen .........,2.0
"not anything terrible, just bland, and boring.",2.0
"also, there are no prices posted of anything, besides the drinks.",2.0
"gave me the cheese, but no fries, and the root beer, but no straw.",2.0
it was the end of our almost attentive service.,2.0
it had a chewy texture and was actually hard to cut through.,2.0
it's supposed to have a different composure.,2.0

"maybe their other food is better, but steer clear of the vegetarian pad thai.",2.0
food was pretty salty.,2.0
the waiter could've used an espresso.,2.0
i started with the queso dip not fully reading the description.,2.0
would have gotten a better rating if the service was better.,2.0
nobu prices so i would expect quality sushi.... but fish didn't taste fresh.,2.0
very cold and unwelcoming.,2.0
not worth the cost of the seafood buffet.,2.0
the rooms looked clean despite the very low lighting in the room.,2.0
the rest of the items were about average in taste.,2.0
we've been here several times and it gets worse every time.,2.0

yesterday their relish was stale.,2.0
pizza is poorly made.,2.0
it is outdated already.,2.0
grilled zucchini was bland and fries are fries.,2.0
the tortillas served with the soup are the same served at taco bell.,2.0

we had to clean our own table while employees leaned against the counter socializing.,2.0
skip this location until they remember what service means.,2.0
"this place does have beer and margaritas, but that doesn't make a good restuarant.",2.0
we're going to try kilgore trout instead.,2.0
the new food is nowhere near as good as what they used to serve.,2.0
not what i expected.,2.0
the food is merely adequate.,2.0
honestly don't get the hype.,2.0
i'm pretty sure the chili dog meal looked the same entering and exiting my body!,2.0

nearly all the main dishes are listed as market price.,2.0
oyster tastes really bad.,2.0
more a place to be seen but not enjoyed!,2.0

"besides, i wasn't too comfortable with their sales tactics.",2.0
"as i did not use them, my review is on the cost.",2.0
i thought the pork's texture was way off.,2.0
they're just rushing around trying to pick items.,2.0
i thought the hollandaise sauce tasted off and the entire dish was too sour.,2.0
i don't think it's ever been cleaned since the place opened.,2.0
my shirts always shrunk after i picked them up from this cleaner.,2.0
my salads were not very tasteful and the soup was okay.,2.0
"so many good places to eat, this is not one of them",2.0
but the food took long to come.,2.0
it has dropped to i won't return and should have stayed with famous daves bbq.,2.0
the food is mediocre for the price.,2.0
not sure exactly what it relates to.,2.0
las ultimas dos veces que compre la carne a salido bien corriosa y dura.,2.0
"not much variety in flavours...red velvet, chocolate, carrot and vanilla.",2.0
"the rest of the meals were ""bad fusion"" food.",2.0
so be careful if you're not sure you want it.,2.0
it was hard to get service after you ordered.,2.0
"what ruined this place for me was the noise level, which was nauseatingly loud.",2.0
"if you're planning a class reunion here, go somewhere else.",2.0
"first of all, no matter what time if year, this airport is always freezing.",2.0
i tried it which was my goal but i don't really see myself returning.,2.0

"yet again, i saw... food here is lacking largely!",2.0
"honestly, i wish i didn't.",2.0

cool concept but the beers are radically overpriced.,2.0
the impatient vibe was definitely not welcoming at all.,2.0
fail on both fronts for this place.,2.0
i don't think i can listen her music anymore.,2.0
the macaroni and cheese was soupy and watered down.,2.0
i will commend the portions they give you.,2.0
"service, not so much.",2.0
we ate our tacos and left wishing we'd tried something else.,2.0
the salad look very pretty but all lettuce!,2.0
"mind you, it wasn't like i had scarfed down my food.",2.0
it felt like it took fucking forever to make a simplistic iced mocha.,2.0
needless to say i think i will be going somewhere else to get my produce.,2.0
what i mean by this comparison is that it didn't have much flavour.,2.0
have found other badminton stores to be much more helpful.,2.0

i love freddy's but this location has terrible service!,2.0
"unfortunately, i can't say what the food tastes like.",2.0
"yes, and such small portions.""",2.0
especially frustrating if you have a group of more than three.,2.0
i felt like i was eating risotto instead.,2.0

"dont sell them your clothes people, it's just not worth the trip.",2.0

so many other options...skip this one.,2.0
it was disappointing for sure.,2.0
the fries where cold and soggy.,2.0
i personally wouldn't order it again.,2.0
almost as surprising is the highly unimaginative menu.,2.0
because of that you may start coughing.,2.0
only reason why i'm giving two stars is because the service was pretty good.,2.0
"so, i went someplace else and was taken big time.",2.0
we will be staying else where on future trips..,2.0

this location has started to go downhill.,2.0
mediocre food at best.,2.0
the server actually seemed pissed off the entire time.,2.0

"the concept is interesting, but the execution lacked.",2.0
once we ordered each course was extremely slow.,2.0
overall really didn't enjoy my experience and will not be going back again,2.0
which has caused me to look elsewhere for nail services.,2.0
the food has also gone way downhill since the days of cantina on east blvd.,2.0
"the problem is crowding, constant breaking machines and cleanliness.",2.0
i feel like they just don't care.,2.0
"we then both had the steak frite, served medium rare.",2.0
i am so disappointed with our take out order last night.,2.0

some things were downright bad.,2.0
it shouldn't have been too hard to be noticed since only three tables were occupied.,2.0

i would recommend eating elsewhere for breakfast.,2.0
meat was tough and the service wasn't that great.,2.0
food was good but the experience was ruined by the terrible service.,2.0
drinks and food aren't that different from applebees down the street.,2.0

"it would have been an easy fix, but they just really don't care.",2.0
"i'll go back to pf changs, but not this one.",2.0
"the portions were decent, but not great.",2.0
there's been a steady downward spiral in the quality of all the dishes.,2.0
the cutting fee and corking fee are way to steep,2.0
not worth the time.,2.0
my boyfriend was over half way finished his dish by the time mine was available.,2.0
not sure i'd order from here again.,2.0
way too long to prepare simple items like a sandwich or a salad.,2.0

my first visit there was not a good one.,2.0
it was a mediocre experience and we won't be back.,2.0
unfortunately the quality of food wasn't that great.,2.0
but i don't think i'll be coming back after tonight.,2.0
with all the salons in town i will surely bring my business elsewhere.,2.0
the pancakes have always been dry or hard.,2.0
the place is really just meh.,2.0
"overall, this was an unmemorable experience.",2.0
but we gave it two chances and neither time were we happy with the service.,2.0

i haven't been since they changed because i didn't hear good things about it.,2.0

the bartenders spend more time socializing with each other than they do serving customers.,2.0
we ordered the signature nachos with chicken which was virtually non exsistant and disappointing.,2.0
"even my girlfriend, who has little tolerance for spicy food thought it was too sweet.",2.0
"however, i think they should have comped me my meal.",2.0
"however, you'll need an italian dictionary to translate the menu.",2.0
there was absolutely no wow factor.,2.0
place is very small.,2.0
"honestly, we both agreed that we have had better at outback.",2.0
i just think for now i would not recommend it specifically in vegas.,2.0
there is really nothing special about the food.,2.0
we all ordered before dinner cocktails which were very very weak.,2.0
the creme brûlée was perhaps the worse thing i ever ate.,2.0
i would have overlooked the slow service if the food had made up for it.,2.0
it was overcrowded so everyone was bumping into each other.,2.0
the chips were way too fat and greasy.,2.0
the fries were cold when they arrived.,2.0
i should never expect much for chinese food in vegas.,2.0
i would understand if i had a large order but not just for one sandwich.,2.0
"but then again,  this really shouldn't be the highlight of a meal.",2.0
was told the food was family style but actually it was more like tapas.,2.0
the service was not great and very long.,2.0
it might just be that the quality nad the service has changed over time.,2.0
ordered the boneless goat and chicken roti... had to say was very disappointed!,2.0
below average mexican food but better than taco bell.,2.0
"the flavor is mostly ""salt"" and the pickles are mushy.",2.0
it took forever to get the order in.,2.0
"nice staff, but they are very pushy when it comes to this ""deep clean"" movement.",2.0
it's sister resto bluestar cafe is way better.,2.0
"the root beer was close, but too sweet for both out tastes.",2.0
didn't feel the food was as fresh as it could have been.,2.0
the portions tend to be on the skimpy side.,2.0
lack of common sense.,2.0
the bar did not go back and correct the issue with everyone else.,2.0
we were pretty disappointed and will not come back for our future visits.,2.0
now i wasn't expecting anything super exceptional.,2.0
"maybe, but i'll get just a slice of plain cheese pizza.",2.0
the bread selection is minimal and not the greatest.,2.0
the burgers were nothing special and quite thin.,2.0
ordered the seafood fettuccine but was quite disappointed actually.,2.0
"expensive, small, and not very good.",2.0
you're better off going to ranch market in gilbert.,2.0
i don't think it tasted any different than any other place.,2.0
"plus they screwed up my online order, gave me gyro meat instead of chicken.",2.0
they did not explain the toppings well.,2.0
they do give you three eggs but they were very small.,2.0
"very little storage, odd mirror placement, not chick friendly....",2.0
the food seemed to lack the love and attention it use to receive.,2.0
"the waiter was trying really hard, but needed some training.",2.0
price was on the cheap side but i probably wont go back.,2.0
i was stoked... until their beer touched my lips.,2.0
the calamari was very fishy tasting.,2.0
the quality just isnt there.,2.0
"would've had the same experience at the other clubs for much less, plus more accommodation.",2.0
this place needs a good cleaning.,2.0
sliced serrano chiles should not define the flavor of my favorite style of soup.,2.0
food here is really overpriced and comes in tiny portions.,2.0
the latte was room temperature at best.,2.0
i've had better ice cream for sure!,2.0
tried a smidgen of everything and nothing tasted fresh.,2.0
it didn't seem to ventilate.,2.0
the large pretzel for appetizer was completely cold.,2.0
there was also a long waiting gap between our appetizers and the entrees.,2.0
unfortunately half my order was tiny pea sized crispy things.,2.0
the food can be summarized as average and not memorable and it's not pricy.,2.0
but the spice was just too overwhelming.,2.0
"i will also echo other reviews that the open kitchen, while cool, was terribly planned.",2.0
it's laughable now but at the time we were super pissed.,2.0
another overrated pgh pizza place.,2.0
i know it comes in the glass bottle but... no.,2.0
"if he had taken our orders, this would be a very different review.",2.0
"wasn't impressed with their salad bar, the meat wasn't all that.....",2.0
but it takes hours and patience to do so.,2.0
there bbq meats are not tasty unless you just like soy sauce spill on meats.,2.0
the food tasted ok hence the two stars otherwise i'd given one star.,2.0
"not cool cox cable, not cool.",2.0
this was my second visit and was disappointed again.,2.0
quality has gone down.,2.0
the pool area also doesn't stack up to other properties.,2.0
my sushi was very bland and my husbands food was dry.,2.0
pool table is useless with the amount of space afforded to players.,2.0
definitely not the best steakhouse in phoenix.,2.0
we stopped on our way through to the coast and we were all unimpressed.,2.0
the only reason im giving this another star is that the place is clean.,2.0
responses are typically slow if they happen at all.,2.0
the room ended up being decent after an hour of air conditioner.,2.0
service is great but the food is dangerous.,2.0
the selection was the usual indian buffet spread but way less hearty.,2.0
they're lucky the beer is good because the service sucks!,2.0

overpriced and under gourmet.,2.0
it is very small and ackwardly shaped.,2.0
"if they did, they would do something to cover the mistakes thay have done.",2.0
there was very little salad and hardly any fresh mozzarella on the bagel.,2.0
"the food required prepayment, which was not what the atmosphere suggested.",2.0
unfortunately the past few times the food has been stale.,2.0
they were very slow at making the food.,2.0
went for happy hour and it was ridiculously overpriced coupled with subpar food.,2.0
"other patrons noticed and he started comping things, but unevenly.",2.0
we found it below our expectations for what they provide for lunch and dinner.,2.0
"they need bottles of sauce on the table, along with extra napkins.",2.0
don't think i'd go back,2.0
the lighting in this place is way too bright for a tavern bar.,2.0
dessert selection was small and was not good.,2.0
"we expected more from a highly rated hotel, underwhelming stay.",2.0
the actual crepe tasted gross and there was no coconut flavor.,2.0
this is closer to where i live but not a fan of the layout.,2.0
i just expected more from the food.,2.0
"slow service, loud music, generally a poor experience.",2.0
sweet potato fries were limp and soggy.,2.0
will definitely go somewhere else next year.,2.0
food is good service is very bad.,2.0
"if you're at caesars, you're better off at the food court, spago, or cheesecake factory.",2.0
"food choice was pretty limited, and not the quality i would expect for the bellagio.",2.0
"unfortunately, i was not impressed.",2.0
the food just wasnt like tge other one!,2.0
this isn't the only panera that i've witnessed the standards of servicing slipping at,2.0
"anyways, onto the food...",2.0
at those prices i would expect a aaa service.,2.0
i went a few minutes before lunch time the other day.,2.0
there needs to be some other chopped veggies in it.,2.0
nothing really impressive about the food or the service.,2.0
you wouldn't know it from the service though.,2.0
needless to say the beers were great.,2.0
went here because we had a free drink coupon....service sucked!!!!,2.0
when we arrived at our table our server was welcoming but also disorganized and confused.,2.0
the atmosphere is nice but the salsa is bland and the chips are horrible.,2.0
"great atmosphere and decor, but the food was just blah.",2.0
"i guess for mall food it was fine, just don't expect much.",2.0
"our new waitress took our food order, no big deal.",2.0
i would only visit if he wanted to while being forced to heat west.,2.0
wont go there again thats for sure.,2.0
"on top of that, the kitchen was incredibly slow.",2.0
the server forgot that i ordered a drink so had to ask twice.,2.0
think the service is slow in the front room get ready for the back room.,2.0
all in all this place is ok to visit but i won't be coming back.,2.0
"it was soggy, with strawberry syrup on top.",2.0
"first of all, erase any notions of high tech thrills.",2.0
the breads were average.,2.0
it was soggy and falling apart.,2.0
"very dated, in need of a major renovation.",2.0

i hate paying decent money for something i feel i could make better myself.,2.0
"nice atmosphere, but the food was a joke.",2.0
"i'm a einstein fan, but this location moves snail slow.",2.0
used to love this place.,2.0

the signature duck confit pasta was extremely salty to the point of being almost inedible.,2.0
the chicken was chewy and rough.,2.0
"our waitress amanda was nice, but the food was cold and just average.",2.0
plus it's always been loud and cramped.,2.0
"service, although polite and nice to talk with, was slow and appeared overwhelmed.",2.0
not a pizza place i can feel confident ordering from again.,2.0
i won't be going back for health reasons alone until they fix that grade.,2.0
might as well go to subway.,2.0
even the sauces with the food was bland.,2.0
it was dry and tough with little or no sauce.,2.0
the food items are now of lower quality and the price has gone up.,2.0
my issue is always with people with poor customer service skills.,2.0
"plus, the food was barely warm.",2.0
it looks like any other dinner salad with a few pieces of chicken on top.,2.0
i used to love this place.,2.0
"the bbq sauce did add some flavour, but not much.",2.0
the place is too small and cramped.,2.0
i went after reading all the above positive reviews and was really disappointed.,2.0
they said because the bottles are really small.,2.0
the two stars are for the food.,2.0
"there was too much cheese, even with the request for light cheese.",2.0
i thought it'd be at least a decent show.,2.0
"unfortunately, i'm not sure i would go back.",2.0
"server forgot our bread, entree, and water.",2.0
for a tiny sandwich of no great taste that's nuts.......go elsewhere.,2.0
they didn't have half of the wines in stock.,2.0
we were expecting something really good for that price.,2.0
the coleslaw was too vinegary.,2.0
which was what we were told when our drinks were taking awhile.,2.0
their cupcakes are good but their customer service is lousy.,2.0
had to ask for silverware when we got our salads.,2.0
"no smiles when you walk in, which is too bad.",2.0
so that's why i give two stars...,2.0
"it was luke warm, crust was overcooked, almost no sauce or cheese.",2.0
the towels are well past their prime and are totally rough and threadbare.,2.0
no value for seniors either.,2.0
the decor has got to go..or at the very least wipe down all the dust..,2.0
"however, i was disappointed with the food and service.",2.0
so just stopped in while i was getting my car worked on.,2.0
later i realize it's not the best job.,2.0
the fries were pretty generic and there was not much flavor in the cheese sauce.,2.0
the food was mediocre.,2.0
rather disappointed with my most recent stay here.,2.0
they were clearly asymmetric in their fit.,2.0
there are a lot of better places in pittsburgh.,2.0
especially boarding fees that include nothing more than a place to sleep.,2.0
service is not a tmc priority.,2.0
water came at the end of the meal.,2.0
"the rooms could have been shared comfortably and partied in pragmatically, no doubt.",2.0
"the chicken was like beef jerky and dry, i guess from sitting all day.",2.0
there is nothing more frustrating than paying for something and not getting it.,2.0
the blackened tilapia was a little fishy and only fair.,2.0
the prices were way to high for what you get.,2.0
not that i expected any after reading these reviews.,2.0
but the entire meal was lackluster and seemed just a half notch above fast food.,2.0
giving this place two stars.,2.0
"otherwise it's all right, but i don't plan on returning here.",2.0
we did not take this because getting something out of them was not the point.,2.0
"tacos were not authentic at all, and flavours were very meh.",2.0
mediterranean food needs to stay overseas where it belongs.,2.0
my score is low because i can never get close to this place.,2.0
food is pretty tasty but service sucks!!!!!!,2.0
the steak i ordered came out well done versus medium.,2.0
or at least i used to.,2.0
probably should leave it just plain.,2.0
the food isn't so great.,2.0

not badly priced at all especially considering the portions .,2.0
also the cakes and pies have always been stale.,2.0
kind of strange and signals to me that it isnt the most efficiently run office.,2.0
i did not try any of their cakes or desserts even though they looked delicious.,2.0
there is nothing fine about dining there.,2.0

food is not good but service is bad!,2.0
we used to go to this restaurant all the time.,2.0
i wasn't able to eat it which was disappointing as otherwise it looked rather promising.,2.0

maybe the tech rubbed the wax in too hard.,2.0
my sweet potato fries were cold.,2.0
"first off, the parking here is horrendous!!",2.0
waiter didn't listen to our order and the pizza sauce was way too sweet.,2.0
i gave it two stars because the crab rangoon was edible.,2.0
associate was indifferent to my presence the day i went in.,2.0
i'd rather have tcby.,2.0
another skewered cornbread patty was dry and tough.,2.0
interior is outdated and feels very old.,2.0
"the beer was okay, nothing special, but the biggest disappointment was the food.",2.0
the donuts were pretty stale.,2.0
the poor service might have been due to high volume though.,2.0
"every course was cold, down to the dessert.",2.0
i could have done my own nails at least that good.,2.0
everything tastes the same as it is fried in the same oil i suppose.,2.0
i gave soul two stars because their food is unique.,2.0

the food was passable.,2.0
went here for summerlicious with my girlfriend and the food was mediocre.,2.0
they came up twice to see what the hold up was.,2.0

several selections on the menu were unavailable when i went.,2.0
"the shrimp was the best thing, but even that was mostly batter.",2.0
"the dining area wasn't being maintained, dirty tables and overflowing trash.",2.0

in a group setup i suppose i would give it a second try.,2.0
not as good as the hype goes.,2.0
clean building but very slow office.,2.0
my husband's water sat empty for most of the meal.,2.0
"it was a new york strip, two gulf shrimp, artichoke hearts, ""fries"", and rubber sauce.",2.0
the fish is fine but seems to be just frozen squares of fish fried up.,2.0
it was mostly just salty and greasy.,2.0
the employees kinda make it awkward  bc they argue with each other.,2.0
the steak was low quality and probably overcooked.,2.0
"i ordered spring rolls, cold spring rolls, and a curry pad thai.",2.0
"i had the chicken tacos, which were rather bland.",2.0
"no options for beverages really, no healthy snacks.",2.0
"service was very slow, probably due to them being understaffed.",2.0
i probably won't be back.,2.0
quite unfair for the level of service we received.,2.0
it doesn't help that they use flimsy towels to ensure water drips down your shirt.,2.0
both of our shrimp came out over done both times.,2.0
there are better places to go to.,2.0
quesadillas are extremely lacking.,2.0
the noise was very nearly unbearable.,2.0
i ordered a burrito.,2.0
the chicken was dry and the sauce looked really artificially colored.,2.0
the service we received was sad.,2.0
the bbq chicken pizza was a huge disappointment.,2.0
overall staff was ok except two were rude.,2.0
not so sure i will be going back.,2.0
i hope the other table wanted medium rare.,2.0
when your roast beef has a rainbow it not fresh.,2.0
i then get my food and instead of collard greens i have cabbage.,2.0
its just not worth the fuss and its overall on the lame side.,2.0
we brought some friends who were also dissappointed.,2.0
"needless to say, i finished i the beer and fries, not so much the burger.",2.0
"we had wings, which were passable.",2.0
"also, last night there was water leaking from a light above the sink.",2.0
bryan was the least helpful of all so far!,2.0
"flavours did not work, meat was extremely fatty and stringy.",2.0
very greasy and an area of the fish was very hard.,2.0
too many options these days.,2.0
we ordered very basic fried rice dishes.,2.0
the only reason for two stars is the price was really cheap.,2.0
their nachos are not good at all.,2.0
that's where it went downhill.,2.0
"on this particular outing with a family of four, things did not go so well.",2.0
"the ""truffles"" on the sandwich were nothing more than regular ol canned mushrooms.",2.0
the short rib dinner was on the dry side and on warm.,2.0
it comes with corn or flour tortillas.,2.0
not that it happened to me.,2.0
the patio is nice but not very clean.,2.0
"when we got there, the place looked empty with two other tables.",2.0
in the end our beverages and appetizers were taken off the bill.,2.0
adequate but overall dissapointed as i've experienced so much better for the price.,2.0
"the chicken portion was quite small, as well.",2.0
"the cashier check out service is much, much slower.",2.0
"my husband couldn't finish his biscuits and gray that came with eggs, etc.",2.0
egg rolls...tiny and tough with not much in it.,2.0
at least they have a security guard.,2.0
i would rather eat at monta until the management gets better.,2.0
the sauces and the fried rice had no flavor.,2.0
so unless you are a smoker you won't enjoy it.,2.0
would i go back probably not.,2.0
not quite what i expected.,2.0
the toast... was actually a slice of cold bread... there to absorb grease i assume.,2.0
"the hamburger was room temperature, the cheese was already hardening.",2.0
i have had much better service and food at other steakhouses..,2.0
more tv's than you know what to look at.,2.0
took a long while to get our bacon and eggs.,2.0
the place is expensive enough without the wait staff trying to upsell at every turn.,2.0
the sauce on the broccoli was poor.,2.0
"tvs showing sports, greasy food, service is fine.",2.0
all in all i more than likely would not return.,2.0
but i was left feeling underwhelmed.,2.0
my main concern with this location is the service and attitude of baristas.,2.0
why would i want to use the store credit when their work was unsatisfactory.,2.0
both times the waitstaff has messed up the order.,2.0
this place was just underwhelming and not up to the usual scotto standards.,2.0
understandable but as a first time client she didn't eve greet me.,2.0
"portions could be larger and the food served warmer, however staff is quick and atttentive.",2.0
the cheese curds were soggy and swimming in oil.,2.0
the mix in that place is so bizzare.,2.0
"verdict....if you are famished and nearby, i guess.",2.0
i have had much better service here from other servers.,2.0
the waitress brought our drinks but not a menu.,2.0
i did not care for the food here.,2.0
the place was way under staffed and those who were working seemed overwhelmed and disorganized.,2.0
my son loves the teachers which is the only reason i gave two stars.,2.0
"strobe, if you read this and want to discuss further, hit me up.",2.0
"overall, was very disappointed.",2.0
staff was not helpful or pleasant.,2.0
he did once ask if i wanted more iced tea.,2.0
two stars for the chef and the great waitress but the facilities are gross.,2.0
"despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't particularly busy, service was quite slow.",2.0
how can you mess up a couple of ice cream cones.,2.0
"it used to have so much flavor, but today it was pretty bland and uninteresting.",2.0
also probably shouldn't have mentioned that i was from out of town.,2.0
i won't go on further but obviously i will think twice before returning.,2.0
they need to improve efficiency.,2.0
"not coming back again, too many other good opinions for quality good food.",2.0
i had to ask different waiters for things that we needed such as napkins.,2.0
all in all it was a very disappointing experience.,2.0
"once i ate the small bit of toppings, the rest wasn't worth eating.",2.0
these were the most boring i've had in a long time.,2.0
nothing special here except expensive bbq.,2.0
and it was over priced..two stars for good service  and nice decor.,2.0
"i love milestones, just not at this location.",2.0
and there were only  a small handful of other people milling around.,2.0
the customer service needs a lot of improvement.,2.0
would be nice if they could be more accommodating in that respect.,2.0
"everything had an odd flavor, like it wasn't quite real food.",2.0
the food was dry and uninspiring.,2.0

frustrating experience and the food was only mediocre.,2.0
they lost our meal orders on both days!,2.0
ignored may be more appropriate...,2.0
not as good as it used to be.,2.0
but yeah the food is all meh and the price is crap.,2.0

the mash potato was very liquid and brussels spouts were burned.,2.0
it had a weird taste and i was left feeling a bit sick afterwords.,2.0
i had breakfast this morning and it was nothing to write home about.,2.0
the technician they sent gives me the vibe of he's not sure what to do.,2.0
not impressed at all with the food.,2.0

this place is just blah.,2.0
but everything about the food was lackluster.,2.0
nice environment but not worth the seemingly extra prices.,2.0
i work late most weekdays and don't normally go out.,2.0
so my veal chops came out over cooked with no sign of pinkness..,2.0
disappointed in this starbucks.,2.0
elle avait aussi été déçue d'une expérience précédente dans la même chaine de restaurants.,2.0
only good thing on my plate was the vegetable sides.,2.0
the wifi was horrendous!!,2.0
other than that i would never go again.,2.0
after waiting for an hour finally some beef was served.,2.0
the flavours were poor and the sashimi sizing was quite small.,2.0
the other workers didn't seem to like their jobs.,2.0
"they just don't have that ""wow"" factor i really need.",2.0

"service is nice, just untrained with no attention to detail.",2.0
they did not like the taste of the custard shakes.,2.0
had high hopes for this place but we were disappointed on a few fronts.,2.0
"the bar, however, was nothing impressive and the clientele wasn't what we were expecting, either.",2.0
i've had better service at bob evans.,2.0
"the burritos were very small and consisted only of chorizo, cheese and beans.",2.0
they tasted watered down and lacked the spice and complexity that they ought to have.,2.0
the sangria was a meh too.,2.0
been here twice or thrice for to go orders.,2.0
"i love chipotle, but this location is definitely substandard by franchise standards.",2.0
if you've been to a vegas buffet this is nothing near it.,2.0
the kitchen is poorly staffed and the wooden plates appear unsanitary.,2.0
usually wendy's is a dependable visit.,2.0
the food was salty and there was nothing special to it.,2.0
"maybe next time, or another starbucks somewhere else.",2.0
the fried pickles had a decent flavor but had way too much breading.,2.0
never again....too many other tastier and budget friendly choices.,2.0
i tried again later and chunks of dirt came out.,2.0

"otherwise, the crowds and smells really ruined it.",2.0
"but...for the kenzo chain that's known for their tonkotsu broth, i was quite disappointed.",2.0
i would skip over this place.,2.0
i should have started the whole job myself and saved money time and angst.,2.0
too many other great places to eat in las vegas to ever bother coming back.,2.0
unfortunately chains rely too much on their big name.,2.0
the only reason for the two stars instead of one was the staff was friendly.,2.0
i heard great reviews but did not live up to the price and quality.,2.0
at least some of the employees who staff this post office are gruff and rude.,2.0
most likely not to return due to the poor service.,2.0
"good location, plenty of parking, neat store, but terrible drinks.",2.0
i couldn't find the bacon jam or the avocado.,2.0
"great menu, bad execution and customer service.",2.0
it was such a turn off.,2.0
employee behind the counter seemed to not care about my dissatisfaction.,2.0
they had a weird flavor.,2.0
i ordered the falafel sandwich and it was meh.,2.0

i see lacking professionalism.,2.0
"not the best thai i've had, tofu was pretty soggy.",2.0
my experience with this place was mediocre at best.,2.0
overly salty and didn't offer much.,2.0
mediocre food and service.,2.0
"poor food selection, torched sushi fall apart and other foods taste decent.",2.0
"they missed several areas of vinyl, which, again, i'll have to redo myself.",2.0
if it wasn't salt it was ketchup or hot sauce.,2.0
"anyway, i can only recommend this place if you're looking for a nice bar.",2.0
the food certainly did not live up to mark mcewan's standards.,2.0
for some reason it took forever to come out.,2.0
this place used to be better.,2.0
it's too stressful to eat there for the food to be worth it.,2.0
it was barely over room temperature and so the darjeeling couldn't steep.,2.0
the food would best be described as bland and greasy.,2.0
bartenders that did finally help me had attitudes and you had to flag them down.,2.0
"after two visits, just not loving either color or haircut enough to return.",2.0
the tortillas were soggy.,2.0
the servers were nice though the manager lacked customer service skills.,2.0
not particularly well located either.,2.0
disappointing to say the least.,2.0
the catfish was greasy and the oysters were soggy.,2.0
just don't order the nachos.,2.0
the sauces which used to be very special have become indifferent.,2.0

i thought the truffles looked awfully big... and then i ate one.,2.0
"i'd say, go there only if you're really feeling the need to apply your originality.",2.0
service was good but the food just wasn't up to par.,2.0
it was very cold in there and there was little children running around playing....,2.0
it took me two times to figure out my feelings on this place.,2.0
air is loud and noisy as well.,2.0
this is made exponentially worse by the fact that the buffet items are limited.,2.0
the food is extremely overpriced and the rolls very small and not that good.,2.0
i ordered the hottie burger which was decent and cold when arrived at the table.,2.0
which really hurts i might add.,2.0
any fast food place probably has  better food at this point.,2.0
was expecting some big cajun flavors and didn't really get any of that.,2.0
felt like the whole thing was in a rush.,2.0
i won't be back unless i have a real hankering for that bisque.,2.0
i will only go back to the ballantyne one.,2.0
"i personally would not go back, even though the food was fantastic.",2.0
"very little cheese, very little flavour.",2.0
if your in a hurry don't expect to be served promptly.,2.0
the cleanliness of the restaurant is practically nonexistent.,2.0
i ordered the salmon dinner which was supposed to have crab meat on top.,2.0
i had hoped the chicken was whole and small portions could be ordered.,2.0
staff all looked too stressed!,2.0
also don't expect your drink occasionally because they think they gave it to you.,2.0
my hair was patchy where she had highlighted and a brassy orange color.,2.0
"perhaps their other floors are better, but i would not recommend the ""meatball floor.""",2.0
giving this a two simply because i've only had one thing from here.,2.0
both my friend and i got the corned beef hash which we did not like.,2.0
pad thai did not taste authentic.,2.0
what i got was more a pile of pulled corned beef.,2.0
getting our vehicle throughout our whole stay was ridiculous.,2.0
not good for business.,2.0
after the first year the crust got soggy.,2.0
service was below average.,2.0
way disappointed and probably won't be going back.,2.0
"we were still waiting on our food, next thing you know.",2.0
minus one star for the washroom being out of service.,2.0
i was expecting a lot more with the reviews given here.,2.0
"one time for dinner, we waited for an hour for our food.",2.0
this place has some potential but i think it lacks good management.,2.0
i've been here twice because i'm nearby but still disappointed.,2.0
i got the feeling the staff just wanted to close up and go home.,2.0
"peanut butter, no jelly...ham, no burger....ahem...you get the the drift.",2.0
"on top of that, the service was less than average.",2.0
not so much...i am not going back.,2.0
so overall...that must be a management issue.,2.0
"i personally think the porch is overpriced, and lacks quality.",2.0
"the next two visits, the results were not terrible but not great either.",2.0
edible but will not order again.,2.0
i also thought they could have mats or something cause the floors are dangerously slippery.,2.0
it was all westernized chinese food.,2.0
none of the times did the food come out in a realistic time frame.,2.0
"tips were obviously going to be made at the men tables, oh well.",2.0
totally it was not a great indian buffet!!,2.0
had probably one of the worst main dishes ever.,2.0
"without the hot sauce, it was dry and almost tasteless.",2.0
the fries were mealy and salt deprived.,2.0
the rice was ok but didn't have much flavor.,2.0
"besides the food, the ordering was very unorganized.",2.0
also frustrating was the hike to get to the d gates.,2.0
our food came and i had to ask again for our beverages.,2.0
"also, the meat was fatty and on the bone, and the soup was watered down.",2.0
"other than those reasons, i'd rather go elsewhere.",2.0
"disappointed, we decided to go eat at one of the nearby restaurants.",2.0
"no spice, heavy sugar.",2.0
they were overpowered with heat and almost no garlic flavor.,2.0
i doubt i'll be back any time soon unless they make some menu changes.,2.0
this is mediocre at best.,2.0
the food was mediocre.,2.0
but the prices a just plain too high.,2.0
so not the most special sashimi either.,2.0
i'm definitely not going back.,2.0
no tortilla chips were offered at our table.,2.0
"but it definitely wasn't, so i probably won't be back.",2.0
burgers were ok tasting but way over priced for what you get!,2.0
"for starters, i did not care for the hard casings on the dogs.",2.0
with the prices being that high it should be much better.,2.0
this obviously takes forever.,2.0
very average food quality.,2.0
the steak was bland.,2.0
food was mediocre at best.,2.0
"moreover, they pile on the cheese...gross!",2.0
probably won't eat here again for that reason alone.,2.0
i am not so impressed with this restaurant.,2.0
"we've had waiters disappear, forget orders and drinks, and bring out wrong orders.",2.0
also disappointing amount of vegetables in the meals.,2.0
the maki rolls also had too much sauce on them.,2.0
i'll pass next time.,2.0
"you'll have to go elsewhere"" weird disconnect led to sad folks w broken bike.",2.0
the only one i found that seemed as cold as it should be was canadian.,2.0
the cake was hard as was the frosting.,2.0
"just like the food, the staff is neither friendly or disgruntled.",2.0
"the facility and experience was nice, but the quality of the ""professional"" photographs were terrible.",2.0
but i've had much better chicken fried rice before.,2.0
but the dusts on the seating area kind of made it unappetizing.,2.0
the main courses were flavorless and unimpressive.,2.0
there was a waitress there that seemed always bothered when we asked for another drink.,2.0
nice atmosphere but food was average at best.,2.0
not worth the price.,2.0
i had the linguine carbonara and it was more like scrambled eggs and noodles.,2.0
i don't imagine they were seasoned at all.,2.0
we asked for our tickets and she got the dirty plates off the table.,2.0
the almond croissant is also bland and dry.,2.0
working there a long time and overworked i think.,2.0
"i purchased ""the best"" but is was defiantly short of the best.",2.0
ok  so they are mediokre at best.,2.0
service is bad and slow.,2.0
very overpriced for those on a budget.,2.0
weird tasting baked beans.,2.0
the burgers look good when presented but again have no flavor.,2.0
i would look elsewhere to shop for a car.,2.0
court foreclosed this winter.,2.0
"however, i was really frustrated with the service today!",2.0
the food was clearly reheated and pretty bland.,2.0
the rewards program is hard to access.,2.0
but i've been five or six times and haven't had a decent meal yet.,2.0
didn't taste like papaya.. it tasted more artificial than anything.,2.0
won't be back anytime soon.,2.0
"residence inns are usually good experiences, but this one was not.",2.0
mine was pretty sweet with the chocolate sauce and it lacked any crisp.,2.0
despite the service the food quality was average at best.,2.0
the special should have been erased off the board.,2.0
the portion sizes were so small!,2.0
"otherwise, i'd rather give my money to people with manners.",2.0
nothing to rave about.,2.0
service was average as well.,2.0
"make sure because i don't want to have to come back again.""",2.0
i was not impressed.,2.0
"the service, food, and atmosphere were all consistently sub par.",2.0
the steam table temperatures were not hot.,2.0
"scenery was nice we ate outside, but it took forever to just get our food.",2.0
machines and equipment not very clean and not being wiped down after use!,2.0
the shrimps were over breaded and dry.,2.0
it was hard to identify the smell but it may have been mildew.,2.0
i ordered a chicken salad wrap and an iced latte.,2.0
"music wasn't that great, and it was definitely not the most hip music out there.",2.0
our pizzas also arrived cold.,2.0
lee's is a much better option down the street.,2.0
"nothing fantastic, but certainly on par with the likes of dairy queen.",2.0
they used to be good but lately are over cooking everything.,2.0
bread was warm but dipping sauce was olive oil with specks of pesto.,2.0
"won't be going back, there are other better options around.",2.0
not sure what her problem is given these aren't special requests.,2.0
not worth the money.,2.0
i can go to a better italian restaurant  for better food and less money.,2.0
twice we have had to go find a server to place our order.,2.0
the staff used to be nice.,2.0
wanted to like this one but can't recommend it.,2.0

"for my first time here, and as a fellow barista, i'm not impressed.",2.0
"this might fall under the category of ""too much information"" but...",2.0
unfortunately the service is less then desirable.,2.0
"so, it's not really much of a win at all.",2.0
way over priced for the type of food served.,2.0
the food was not that good for the price not worth it.,2.0
"atmosphere is great, but food is most definitely overpriced!",2.0
everything we got was very bland.,2.0
the sauce was mediocre as well.,2.0
"our server was nice, but we rarely saw her during our visit.",2.0
so not worth it.,2.0

"but as far as shopping experience goes, i'll probably never go back.",2.0
"some had plates on them, but most of them were full of crumbs.",2.0
the seasoning was plain.,2.0
at least the sauce anyway.,2.0
had higher hopes for a place with such a cute name!,2.0
i'd rather spend twice as much on a meal that i'd actually enjoy.,2.0
that was pretty cool but other than that the customer service was generically mediocre.,2.0
not much else to say.,2.0
the café was filled with people chatting or working on laptops.,2.0
"the store in general feels cramped, crowded and neglected.",2.0

and they have no hot mustard for the saimin and wonton min.,2.0
was very disappointed with the food.,2.0
"definitely not a winner in my book, or my daughter's.",2.0
"i probably won't return, there are plenty of other places to eat in the casino.",2.0

dining is nice but rooms are horrible.,2.0
service was very slow and the place was less than half full.,2.0
tripe was too tough to eat and cut into huge pieces.,2.0
it's edible and fills your tummy.,2.0
didn't felt welcoming at all.,2.0
"i've given two stars because in the beginning, they were great.",2.0
"i will not go back, i've been to far better in the valley.",2.0
there are probably better shawarma lunch specials around this area.,2.0
the waitress was in a huge rush and wasn't that attentive or friendly.,2.0
insanely expensive and not the freshest.,2.0
once we got the food it was just bland.,2.0
not necessarily their fault.,2.0
i've had better quality at other buffets for less than half the price.,2.0
the crab rangoon is entirely too greasy and way too stuffed!,2.0
everything is overly sweetened.,2.0

she ordered a salad and i ordered a steak.,2.0
this should be a fun warm inviting atmosphere but even the kitchen is sketchy.,2.0

place just didnt feel clean to me.,2.0
when we got home the pizza was a mess and greasy.,2.0
it will probably be my last time there.,2.0
but the food is half rate and its not an amazing atmosphere.,2.0
"it's mall food, true, but it's like they don't really care.",2.0
this would be acceptable if the prices had not remained the same.,2.0
"despite the appealing description, the salad was everything but.",2.0
which means small overrated portions of food.,2.0
"music was okay but i don't appreciate the rude bartender, super unnecessary.",2.0
"cabo, i'm just not that into you.",2.0
"the cheese was barely melted and it made the texture gritty, which is not pleasant!",2.0

washrooms were filthy and nothing to wipe your hands on.,2.0
at the end of the meal we waited a long time again for the check.,2.0
waited for our drink orders to be taken.,2.0
"no more, not worth it.",2.0
generic baked goods and cafeteria style cuisine make for an uninspired meal all around.,2.0

there was a looooong wait between ordering and receiving each course.,2.0

that stinks because i think it was the most expensive pasta dish on the menu.,2.0
"furthermore, my bowl of hot and sour soup was neither hot or sour.",2.0
"i'm used to eating seafood, and these were just strange.",2.0
it seemed like they were taking too many people for the staff they had.,2.0

"not sure what valley they are talking about, but definitely not the best in phoenix.",2.0
the one thing that completely turned me off was the scallops dish.,2.0
just not worth it.,2.0
but the food itself just wasn't good.,2.0
i had to added hoison sauce and siracha into my broth for flavor.,2.0
we had an hour and we missed the movie because the service was slow.,2.0
"next time, we'll be staying somewhere else.",2.0
