i almost had to put on my glasses for finding the burger.,2.0
"taco tuesday no more,   prices doubled.",2.0

the flavor was just meh.,2.0
i only gave them two stars because that is what i truly feel.,2.0
when pizza arrived had ground sweet sausage for the extra hot sausage.,2.0

"it was somewhat palatable, but not enough for me to finish the dish.",2.0
i shouldn't be complaining too much... at least we did have air conditioning this visit.,2.0
the meals are extremely overpriced.,2.0
that likely lessens patrons...vicious cycle.,2.0

this place is really overrated.,2.0
it was empty when we arrived and the cashier was very low in energy.,2.0

there are better places to get breakfast in madison.,2.0
almost to the point where it's not even worth coming here for the food..,2.0
i'm sorry to say we were underwhelmed.,2.0
upon check in the room reeked of smoke so i switched rooms.,2.0

i found there was a weird overpowering salty taste that ruined the meal.,2.0
orange chicken had literally zero kick.,2.0
i would recommend babycakes inside the m instead.,2.0
they get two stars only because they fixed the problem.,2.0
prices are not labeled in most cases and the monthly specials are not honored.,2.0
instead he is modified into some weak prefab aural spectrum wallpaper.,2.0
for a dollar more order the new thin crust pizza.,2.0
not sure if i'll ever come here again.,2.0
there weren't many people in the restaurant.,2.0
"decor is the same, super sterile feeling.",2.0
although the chicken had a good flavor it was incredibly dry.,2.0
my mongolian beef was tough and fatty.,2.0
i come here from time to time and regret it each time.,2.0
"if they want to compete with seoul chako, they need to lower their prices.",2.0
the best was to describe it is oily water with a hint of beef.,2.0
i don't like the new stuff out there.,2.0
extreme attitude over the intercom too when placing an order.,2.0
that to me is definitely not a one off.,2.0

i finally interrupted two salespeople who were engrossed in conversation.,2.0
our first visit to cluck n cleaver was disappointing.,2.0
my experience was certainly not as positive as the others with oil changers...,2.0
there are other better places nearby.,2.0
expected more from a sushi place at the bellagio.,2.0
it's more like the seasoning was only on the outside but bland on the inside.,2.0

and the pita chips are bland!,2.0
it's not really scary at all.,2.0
"i've tried it twice, and was not impressed.",2.0
but the food wasn't much better than applebee's and the wine menu was poor.,2.0
"ordered the beet salad to start, nice size but tasted like canned beets.",2.0
would of been fine had they given me a descent amount of meat tho.,2.0
"there was no complimentary coffee in the lobby, either.",2.0
the store has fairly limited selection and high prices.,2.0
i won't be back any time soon with so many great dining options in town.,2.0
normally love this place but today was disappointing.,2.0

the menu has recently been changed for the worse.,2.0
"flowers didn't look fresh, colors were wrong.",2.0
i love uo but this store reaks of sewage.,2.0

the egg was dry.,2.0
subway is so much better.,2.0
"the shanghai noodles, which had been reviewed as spicy, were not at all spicy.",2.0
way better burger places in other parts of town.,2.0
"also, it kind of sucks how they do not have water for free there.",2.0
tried this today for the first time and was really less then impressed.,2.0
plus it gets loud at night.,2.0
i would rather pay a little more and leave with healthy bits.,2.0
its really turning me off of this place.,2.0
"the salad was very ""vinegary"" and the filet was ... ""eh"".",2.0
there are better filipino  restaurants around.,2.0

sometimes the ice tea seems like it's sat too long....,2.0
they need to hire more staff to handle the morning rush.,2.0

only saving grace is that they pile on the meat here.,2.0
nothing really stood out as great...,2.0
first the atmosphere...this restaurant is loud and the lighting is bright.,2.0
they also didn't have any coolers....hot summer day..no coolers..,2.0
but that's what i get for getting my first detail and not doing research.,2.0
drinks cost more than other venues.,2.0
i ordered the salty pretzel to start and a bacon cheese burger.,2.0
i would purchase elsewhere if i didn't have the gift card to spend.,2.0
over priced watered down bubble tea.,2.0
chef palmer needs to dine in his own restaurants once in a while.,2.0
interesting combination of raw yolk with smoke trout...but over all the balance was missng.,2.0
it is pretty bad.,2.0
"seriously, i could have done better with a packaged cake mix.",2.0
even with their ayce option it is far too expensive.,2.0
"also, there really wasn't much variety.",2.0
the only thing more bland than the carne asada is the chicken.,2.0
would not repeat until they offer better platter combos.,2.0
not really worth the drive across town.,2.0
"all in all, the meal sucked and it was served lukewarm.",2.0
can't say i would return when i go back to montreal.,2.0
chilaquiles were indistinguishable from nachos and did not come with the promised beans.,2.0

that was the only good part of the meal.,2.0
the inside was cold it was so rare.,2.0
the place does not look anything like the pics.,2.0
won't be visiting again.,2.0

food seems a tad overpriced.,2.0
but menu is odd and wine had sediment.,2.0
but the service was less than desirable.,2.0
the patio at la hacienda was the best thing about this restaurant unfortunately.,2.0
food was average at best.,2.0
perhaps they are trying to do too much.,2.0
the problem is it just keeps falling short.,2.0
"it also had three buns on it, which makes no sense.",2.0
she just looked anoyed.,2.0
"while the employees seem to try most days, the food is inconsistent.",2.0
maybe i should have waited for them to get the kinks out.,2.0
that was my major problem.,2.0

the men washrooms are tight.,2.0
probably won't go back and i was disappointed given all the great reviews.,2.0
"food however is nowhere close to ""authentic"" german.",2.0
i'm not sure why anyone has given this place higher than two stars.,2.0
she took our orders and begrudgingly brought us drinks.,2.0
some people always have to pack up while others are still starving.,2.0
direct docking tidal was an unfair comparison.,2.0
it was just that forgettable.,2.0
"we found it to be a bizarre, uncomfortable, and unsatisfying experience.",2.0
i like fish and chips to be light and fluffy but these were not.,2.0
and it was just okit actually ruined our night we won't be back.,2.0
it's very unfortunate that the service we received was well below par.,2.0
the sides were definitely blah.,2.0

"honestly, i would've rather ordered papa johns.",2.0
we fully decided to go elsewhere for our next meal.,2.0
the tvs were blaring and seating was uncomfortable too.,2.0
but the food is bland an uninspired.,2.0
dishes which are supposed to be mildly sweet are too sweet.,2.0
the service was also typically chinese...i.e.,2.0
can do better at just about any mall food court that serves chinese.,2.0
honestly they were being kids.,2.0
the house salad that we ordered was also nothing special.,2.0
"also, my wife and i both had fried chicken which was extremely dry.",2.0

there's a reason these places are only in food courts.,2.0
no excuse for breakfast place.,2.0
this place used to be a great hangout spot.,2.0
we rushed over to the gelato kiosk to rid our mouths of the greasy aftertaste.,2.0
all toppings should be spread evenly throughout the entire pizza.,2.0

bit frustrating and no apologies from the staff.,2.0
i saw a couple drinking tea out of coffee mugs.,2.0
"ordered the brioche french toast, came out way undercooked.",2.0
my dad didn't appreciate the bad attitude.,2.0
the meat was tough and not very tasty.,2.0
that sucker should have been piping hot.,2.0
"just stayed a week at the ""riviera"".",2.0
biriyani was not pleasing to eat.,2.0
tasted more like a dark chocolate shake instead of a milk chocolate shake.,2.0
i could tell it bothered him the way it bothered me.,2.0
the cracked egg on cheyenne has the same food and much better service.,2.0

i asked for crispy and it's barely cooked.,2.0
the lack of hd technology around the stadium is also somewhat embarrassing.,2.0
i wouldn't recommend this place or go back here.,2.0

not impressive at all the corn tortillas were rubbery in the enchiladas.,2.0
"while the food tasted ok, it was served completely cold.",2.0
i felt like there wasn't enough selections to choose from.,2.0
giving two stars is about the best compliment i can give this place.,2.0
flemings broils or cooks over a gas grill.,2.0

the whole thing together with the potatoes was starchy and boring.,2.0
"yeah, right, someone screwed our reservation up i think.",2.0
the food was very bland i got the pancakes and bacon.,2.0
instead of these crunchy mushrooms it would've been nice to have some veggies instead.,2.0
the quality and order accuracy varies so much its no longer worth it.,2.0
"true to its american theme, everything here is oversize and average.",2.0
it's a very tiny restaurant and the tables are really close to each other.,2.0
the biggest disappointment was the cannoli.,2.0

there are regular water issues and mold.,2.0
the fries were thin and on the crunchier side.,2.0
the tempeh sandwich was bland and mostly tasted of garlic because of the chimmichurri.,2.0
might be fresh or might not be.,2.0

even the pineapple was falling off which shouldn't happen...,2.0
maybe they should change the name to emo cafe.....its depressing.,2.0
the gym is crap but usually apartment gyms are.,2.0
the dealers were less than friendly.,2.0
our entire experience was ruined though due to the service.,2.0
"if you are going to come here, try to do patio to avoid the smell.",2.0
tuna should be dark in colour and should should be firm.,2.0
my eggs were strange and watery.,2.0

overpriced and no service.,2.0
the place is obnoxiously loud and conversation is next to impossible.,2.0

"walmart hotel form sorta, except the employees seem to care.",2.0
the food seems not to be the reason however.,2.0
"the homemade chips, which the waitress raved over, were cold.",2.0
the problem i have is that you need to train their salespeople better!,2.0
we will think long and hard before giving this place a try anytime soon.,2.0

"i've tried several yum cha places around montreal, this one's ranked lowest.",2.0
the beef and rice tasted like they been under the light the whole morning.,2.0

"either time though, i won't be in your way.",2.0
had to use the marinara from my garlic knots to make the pizza less dry,2.0
you need more staff working the takeout counter.,2.0
"in a nutshell, the breakfast food was disappointing.",2.0
i did not understand that.,2.0
"when we hooked up to our truck, the blinkers and breaklights  were still not working.",2.0
all our dishes from appetizer to desert were stingy.,2.0
same price less food.,2.0
i felt as if our server was trying to get rid of us.,2.0

as the rating says i've experienced better.,2.0
the chicken don was terribly sweet and didn't have enough chicken.,2.0
"this is a ""steak on a plate"" type of joint, everything costs extra.",2.0

the service is quite slow and the staff's use of english seems limited.,2.0

we ordered a salmon sashimi and made us disappointed.,2.0
i ordered the athena pizza and i was very disappointed.,2.0
the food was half good and half not too good.,2.0
its messy and dirty!,2.0
nothing like some soggy spinach leaves to turn your stomach.,2.0
the taste was not that great either.,2.0

there are far better options in the city for much better value.,2.0
lunchtime service is horrible!,2.0
if you just want coffee they are ok but other than that service is poor.,2.0
not in this case.,2.0
the time given for pickup is not close to the actual time of pickup.,2.0

it took a long time.,2.0
we left wanting for something more.,2.0
no offer to clean or anything.,2.0
i don't think i will ever come back here.,2.0
kind of hard to stir your coffee without a spoon.,2.0
don't see the value or appeal.,2.0
mcalister's deli is pretty boring and doesn't have many vegetarian friendly options in general.,2.0
something just doesn't seem right.,2.0
a crepe station is something i would have been all over.,2.0
also most times my order comes out wrong.,2.0
"however....my primary complaint is the lack of consistency, which i've heard from others also.",2.0
they didn't cook the beef like regular teriyaki.,2.0
so soggy that you can't pick up the sandwich with your hands.,2.0
most of the dishes were fusion styled and quite overpriced.,2.0
definitely the slowest starbucks in the valley.,2.0
"regardless of appearance, he was flat out rude.",2.0
"this taco mac, however, is terrible.",2.0
"the slides were short, slow and weak compared to others we've been to.",2.0
single tables stop being a priority when there is a large party that is there.,2.0
downtown las vegas is gross and filthy as it is.,2.0
all you could taste were essentially the salt.,2.0
definitely not worth all the hype and long lines.,2.0
you get what you ordered and the experience is over.,2.0
the sandwich the buzz  though was a few slices of meat on a small bun.,2.0
"it's somewhere on par with a wendy's junior bacon cheeseburger, minus the bacon.",2.0
i almost felt like we were an inconvenience and they were dead.,2.0
"while i hope they do well, i wasn't impressed enough to return.",2.0
"had the pecan pesto chicken sandwich, the meat was so bland!",2.0

i didn't know chicken could be that dark.,2.0

even my fountain drink had a strange taste to it.,2.0
not a place for a serious diner or just a casual sipper.,2.0
we were very disappointed in our steaks.,2.0
there was only one cashier even though there were two windows.,2.0
pad thai is so oily.,2.0
they spoke way too fast as if they are in a rush.,2.0
nice people and great pedicure chairs but they left me with cuts on my heels.,2.0
i'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience.,2.0
don't plan to return after that experience.,2.0
the bill was far too high for the quality of food.,2.0
unfortunately my burger which i ordered medium rare was close to medium well.,2.0
not sure that we'll return.,2.0
the banana nutella crepe was also undercooked.,2.0
"tivoli square is beautiful, but ultimately boring.",2.0
"first, i found it odd that there were no pool servers or cocktail waitresses.",2.0
sorry a la turque.,2.0
there's just a very long wait and not very many legitimate servers to refill drinks.,2.0
however i just wanted a good cup of coffee.,2.0
i guess i thought it was supposed to be crunchy.,2.0
"i will use the comp car wash that came with it, but won't go back.",2.0

i expected much more.,2.0
i ordered three grilled chicken tacos and the tortillas were cold.,2.0
also no kids menu.,2.0
the chow fun was passable.,2.0
the samosas were oily and the covering was chewy.,2.0
second the gyro meat way dry.,2.0
the salsa tasted like it was a bit watered down with pizza sauce.,2.0
although our waiter was nice the staff is a little unprofessional overall.,2.0
there were black marks by the motor and had obviously been used before and refurbished.,2.0
not sure if i will be back.,2.0
not a lot for either of these people to take care of.,2.0
this was less creamy and more sweet tangy with an off flavor... oh!,2.0
"but first of all, the ceiling in our room is totally unfurnished.",2.0
still here at this ihop location and not off to a good start.,2.0
its interior could use a major make over.,2.0
"the verde salsa was identified on the menu as ""mild"".",2.0
the only thing saving this place is their big projection tvs.,2.0
i don't know if i would come back here.,2.0
food plated nicely but lacking flavor.,2.0
"overall, portions did not match the prices... and we won't be returning to eat here.",2.0
there were long lines because they were unable to ticket passengers.,2.0
i asked for new towels and sheets that did not look clean either.,2.0
"i ordered to pick up,  hoping good bbq would make up for the price.",2.0
my fiance didn't care for her dish either.,2.0
"it may have been cooked that day, but i expected it fresh off the grill.",2.0
the staff was pretty friendly but the food was not the greatest.,2.0
i don't think i'll ever go back.,2.0
"for the price and the lineup, i feel it is not worth it.",2.0
i'll think twice before going back.,2.0
the next day most of my nails fell off.,2.0
we won't be back to bartram.,2.0
the salads at california pizza kitchen are far more creative and tasty than this was.,2.0
my burger came back incorrect and was not very good at all.,2.0
i don't know if we'll go back.,2.0
the loaded baked potato was lacking with toppings and definitely not loaded.,2.0
service was disappointing however.,2.0
prices are high but people pay for the convenience of a late night tea spot.,2.0
won't be back for dinner again.,2.0
this place was so so.,2.0
roast beef was like overcooked steakumms and burger was dry.,2.0
dirty carpet at entrance.,2.0
"in these kind of places you expect prices to be right, but they were not.",2.0
pollo fundido arrived cold.,2.0
thai tea was way too strong.,2.0
i've worked in retail before and that's not something you should do.,2.0
the chicken curry is actually smelly and it has some raw chicken feel to it.,2.0
the young blond man that served me just gave me attitude.,2.0
i was pretty disappointed in my experience and surprised.,2.0
food was just so so.,2.0
"food is cold, and always the same selection.",2.0
food was ok but service was incredibly slow for a small lunch crowd.,2.0
the food was decent but the service was terribly slow.,2.0
luchtime is patio dining only with a restricted menu.,2.0
that was pretty much the last good sentiment of the visit.,2.0
the food is expensive and takes forever to get to your table.,2.0
it wasn't very welcoming.,2.0
there are much better options in the area for the money.,2.0
"i guess that shifts the balance from ""mediocre"" to ""dine if you dare"".",2.0
next the food was very slow to get to the table and not very warm.,2.0
"i was hoping for that fresh taste, but i got a dominos taste.",2.0
extremely over priced for our experience!,2.0
"the sandwiches were cold, dry and unappetizing and the bread was stale.",2.0
"unfortunately, the staff wasn't nearly as excited to see us.",2.0
they could be 'eataly'  or more sophisticate italian food collection place with more live seafoods.,2.0
"he also only talked to my husband and avoided me, which was weird.",2.0
the chicken teriyaki was very unappetizing looking until the sauce went on.,2.0
have noticed the service and food going downward.,2.0
and it wasn't okay.,2.0
"lights too bright, wear shades.",2.0
"hopefully, they will reevaluate how they communicate with patients and make improvements.",2.0
"not sure who does their pricing research, but they need to do a better job.",2.0
the atmosphere and location are nice but the food was horrendously bland.,2.0
it didn't help that the staff wasn't that friendly.,2.0
"it's circumstantial, this was just my experience.",2.0
i asked if the crab cakes were lump and was told yes.,2.0
"not the best carne asada fries, not even close!",2.0
the coffee machine didn't work.,2.0
but this place had a strong funky smell like carpet cleaner or something.,2.0
"just ate there again, had the same thing and it was not good.",2.0
stick with the overpriced beers on the patio.,2.0
but this place is quite pricy for the selections.,2.0
which i really wouldn't have thought too much about if the food was great.,2.0
"the sharables were very small, not exactly sharable.",2.0
"then we ordered our entrees, they came and we still had no silverware or napkins.",2.0
"while the food was good, the experience was not.",2.0
poor service and marginal food.,2.0
the rooms were mediocre at best.,2.0
"anyway, we didn't enjoy the food.",2.0
the california salad was small.,2.0
there was more onion than actual noodles.,2.0
"usually i have something good to say in my reviews, but not today.",2.0
that's why i give a extra half star for their drink.,2.0
overly priced with poor service and good food.,2.0
very disappointed with the experience last night.,2.0
service could have been more attentive but we never felt rushed.,2.0
the checkout lines were awful.,2.0
very slim choices for veggie burgers.,2.0
the music is way too loud!!!,2.0
"frankly if it wasn't for that, i would have found this place overpriced.",2.0
the steak was properly cooked with a decent sauce.,2.0
food was mediocre at best.,2.0
not the best experience!,2.0
i'd rather go to an apple store to do it.,2.0
no frills is much much better.,2.0
looked 'clean' but old.,2.0
the ladies room was dingy and dirty with no hot water.,2.0
"but the margarita was flavourless and boring, with no visible bocconcini.",2.0
from food choices to splitting the bill everything seemed to be an ordeal.,2.0
"they were crisp, but had very little flavor.",2.0
the decor is the only thing people are talking about.,2.0
really doubt i'll be back.,2.0
it was difficult to navigate around with the oddly placed couch area.,2.0
menu entrée was limited.,2.0
"not acceptable, especially with this many servers and this small a dining room.",2.0
"however, my meal, a lime chicken sandwich was not very good at all.",2.0
they are very disorganized about scheduling.,2.0
i probably wouldn't stay in any of them again.,2.0
priced a lot higher than what its worth.,2.0
my huevos rancheros was very salty.,2.0
"the atmosphere here is outstanding, but the food quality and preparation has gone down.",2.0
it also was missing the ham and cheese.,2.0
the sauce was very over powering and it was drenched in it.,2.0
i was pretty disappointed with this place.,2.0
the dough was very flimsy and seemingly undercooked.,2.0
mediocre food and mediocre service at a high price.,2.0
i guess lunch isn't their emphasis anymore.,2.0
been to eat at better buffets in vegas.,2.0
dry and bland and sort of chewy.,2.0
in general the hotel seemed overwhelmed and staff abrupt and frazzled.,2.0
the gate to entrance by our room to enter the hotel was broken.,2.0
"on the plus side, my eggs were perfectly poached with deliciously runny yolks.",2.0
when i asked our server she agreed but said they were all too sweet.,2.0
while coming home from hawaii the stewardess were very unpleasant.,2.0
there are some other places near this restaurant that are better choices.,2.0
i would pass... oh and this was on a sunday!,2.0
"in general, the staff is not organized at all.",2.0
not sure i would stay there again.,2.0
food was over priced for what it was.,2.0
the portions were small and was enough for a lite meal.,2.0
finally the bartender took our order.,2.0
the service was slow.,2.0
there has to be a better way to organize the distribution.,2.0
i got a bowl of mac and cheese instead of my alfredo.,2.0
the container is small and filled halfway with chips.,2.0
it didn't taste any better than it looked.,2.0
perhaps its because its a realtively new location or just lack of training.,2.0
salmon filet not recommended for this price.,2.0
i asked the waitress and she didn't know what i was talking about.,2.0
"it's only just starting, but overpriced for very underwhelming cuisine.",2.0
biggest issue was that the patio and the indoor seating areas were absolutely filthy.,2.0
my one gripe is that they don't put enough meat in their tacos.,2.0
okay for a quick bite but nothing more than that.,2.0
"the fried rice had raw onions, and the rice was dry.",2.0
"also, the noise reduction isn't that significant.",2.0
i just don't love the bread.,2.0
my biggest issue overall was the wording posted everywhere about why this change was made.,2.0
not sure i will be coming back anytime soon.,2.0
their drive thru line up is always long and tight.,2.0
food wasn't authentic as i thought it would be.,2.0
the service was lacking.,2.0
been here twice now within a year span and havent seen any improvement.,2.0
the employee was really nice but her knowledge regarding phone products was bad!,2.0
the wait times are also ridiculous.,2.0
waiting on drink refills.,2.0
the music is ok and the crowd... meh.,2.0
"overall, we had a horrble experience because of the service.",2.0
there were racks of unorganized clothes and bins of accessories.,2.0
"staff was friendly, but not sure we'll come back.",2.0
"i am blonde and husband is bald, so this is definitely not ours.",2.0
the lobster was dry.,2.0
"the patty was unevenly cooked, even the gravy was not able to cover that.",2.0
meatball appetizer was weird.,2.0
"unfortunately, i'm left pretty disappointed.",2.0
"it's supposed to be hospitality, but i'm afraid that in these times, it ain't happening.",2.0
this place was pretty disappointing to say the least.,2.0
"i still will never go back, but you may have an okay experience here.",2.0
"we ordered bulgogi jeongol, it was extrordinarily sweet.",2.0
room service trays were left in the hallway all day.,2.0
"the teriyaki was okay, but i've had better.",2.0
but counter help needs an adjustment.,2.0
the bathrooms were filthy!,2.0
"theirs was way, way to tough and not thoroughly cooked.",2.0
the margherita pizza was subpar.,2.0
"i've been to panchero's, and i probably won't go back.",2.0
there were four of us and we split or four entrées amongst us.,2.0
fries were no better.,2.0
all in all not a great value.,2.0
it was literally brown rice with some oil and vegetables.,2.0
"i have ordered from here multiple times, but this might be my last.",2.0
"most of their rolls priced on the higher end, especially considering.",2.0
just overall disappointed for what they are compared to what they used to be.,2.0
they need to hire more waiters.,2.0
portion size was weak!,2.0
"meanwhile, i was with a diabetic who only picked the ""sugar free"" options.",2.0
i think this place is really overrated.,2.0
the servers are honestly so snobby.,2.0
didn't care for the atmoshphere...kind of dingy.,2.0
but the restaurant needs a makeover and a good cleaning,2.0
clean fast food restaurant but the food was horrible tasting and looking.,2.0
"lastly, the table have nails coming to surface.",2.0
the dough was slightly undercooked.,2.0
the waiter was also very snobby and had quite an attitude.,2.0
the service was pretty lame.,2.0
but if you're use to real cheese steak these fall short.,2.0
fewer food options than tgi fridays and not as good quality.,2.0
their menu is probably too large for them to do any one thing well.,2.0
the beef carpaccio wasn't very good at all.,2.0
i tried to look up the fabric makeup but the tags were removed from everything.,2.0
it would not surprise me to find out they never recycled in the first place.,2.0
the whole experience made us felt unwelcome.,2.0
"self serve beverages, and outside the fresh eggs prepped, it needs a quality upgrade.",2.0
i don't think i will come here again.,2.0
spiceness added to make up for the lack of flavor.,2.0
the eggs were barely warm and french toast lacked flavor.,2.0
very little selection of meat.,2.0
"the salsa is served in old fashion carafes, and just doesn't have any kick.",2.0
"food is not fresh, ordered the mixed tandoori platter.",2.0
with an older waitress in the back of the dining room.,2.0
but the pizza quality could be better.,2.0
the service at this place is spotty.,2.0
maybe skip the happy hour.,2.0
"the flavors were all there, but the texture ruined the dish.",2.0
i don't see this lasting long.,2.0
food and drinks were extremely overpriced for their quality.,2.0
i don't understand what the big deal is about this place.,2.0
too many other better restaurants in downtown summerlin,2.0
i'm probably not going back.,2.0
we would have loved to have some actual flavor but someone forgot to add that,2.0
service was very slow but at least the cashier apologized for my wait.,2.0
i won't write too much about this buffet.,2.0
we didn't like the service.,2.0
this place needs to have expiration dates and prices printed on the food.,2.0
the ho products were few and basically for beginning modelers.,2.0
lots of anxiety and frustration.,2.0
it seemed even to have pickles on it.,2.0
"both were edible, but nothing you would ever go back for.",2.0
not sure when we will be back to eat here again soon.,2.0
"i had the ""homemade"" corned beef hash and eggs and it was another big disappointment.",2.0
i wasn't too impressed with the condition of the restaurant or the food itself.,2.0
my biggest disappointment was the lack of service.,2.0
so many better ones around there.,2.0
perhaps had i ordered a different entree i would have had a better experience.,2.0
but these obviously can't make up for the lacklustre grub.,2.0
i'd honestly feel a lot better about this place if they weren't exhorting my culture...,2.0
and what was served was cold.,2.0
and the spices were bland.,2.0
i tried the vanilla coconut and had no coconut flavour.,2.0
there is nothing special about this place.,2.0
in the past they've served me decently sized pieces of fish with the fries.,2.0
limited drinks and table was sticky.,2.0
"we wait weeks to hear from the practice, even months at times.",2.0
can't really say i liked breakfast.,2.0
our visit to yard house today was quite disappointing.,2.0
this place needs a hygiene update...desperately..people and the tables.,2.0
i used to really like coming here.,2.0
the guy also looked high.,2.0
no wifi in the rooms.,2.0
i'm sure i can find better bubble tea elsewhere.,2.0
"for dessert, we had a brownie sundae, which was obviously microwaved.",2.0
that was not the case here.,2.0
even that didn't work sometimes.,2.0
i used to love this place and the service has gone down hill.,2.0
do not remember what i ordered.,2.0
i did see another customer getting help from another sales person.,2.0
"after going here for years, boy were we disappointed.",2.0
and there wasn't even a raucous dance floor or anything.,2.0
pretty brutal service as far as ihops go.,2.0
"but really, this place isn't that great.",2.0
"i ordered my steak medium rare, it came out well done.",2.0
all four dishes we ordered were mediocre at best.,2.0
not very happy it's making me not want to come back.,2.0
they recooked the fish but didn't really acknowledge the associated risk.,2.0
the chicken was dry and the beef was the better choice.,2.0
"i have to say, it's way, way overrated.",2.0
"however, when i took a bite of the burrito i was let down.",2.0
atmosphere is awesome but food not so much.,2.0
would probably not go back given all of the other options in vegas.,2.0
overall i'd rather go to a national chain.,2.0
"even after taking this out, the burger was so so.",2.0
marg's are subpar now.,2.0
taiwanese food can be done so much better.,2.0
this place just needs a good general cleaning and a little training for the staff.,2.0
sadly it falls very short of the potential.,2.0
"i guess i have to write more to make this review count, so...",2.0
it was unpleasant and i didn't stick around for long.,2.0
maybe there won't even be a next time.,2.0
maybe the tacos and burgers are better!,2.0
the service wasn't spectacular.,2.0
i had the garlic ginger broccoli chicken and it was not very good.,2.0
the menu is small and vague.,2.0
especially since half of all the food is just desserts.,2.0
the front staff seemed to be messy and not very cordial or professional.,2.0
margaritas are too expensive considering that they use lemon juice that is not fresh.,2.0
a major chain like baja should have the resources to get their ac fixed properly.,2.0
tried the chicken stuffed poblano but chicken pieces were overcooked.,2.0
that'll be the last time i get tires at costco.,2.0
the store doesn't not have as much stock as other targets.,2.0
the wait staff was not that great either!,2.0
"they have some funny rolls, but just don't taste right.",2.0
i'd rather travel a bit further to henderson and get my money's worth.,2.0
they don't have a big magazine selection.,2.0
if it wasn't 't for the price i'm sure we would stick with it.,2.0
"service was slow with only two customers, including us.",2.0
the sevice was bad.,2.0
"maybe it was an off day, but i will not return.",2.0
the ma did not share my vitals.,2.0
"plenty of better pizza places nearby, i suggest skipping this particular one.",2.0
especially when you ask for no onions on your burger.,2.0
the food itself was pretty disappointing.,2.0
the mussels were a complete salt bomb.,2.0
maintenance requests have gone uncompleted.,2.0
the place looks like a construction site.,2.0
so odd as that is part of the meal you are paying for.,2.0
i would much rather purchase from a nicer place of business.,2.0
i guess it's just the blasé manner of the hostess and her misinformation.,2.0
the bathroom had a nice counter but the cabinet and flooring were dirty and old.,2.0
the mussels were meh.,2.0
the price did shock me.,2.0
nice bar for rocker types but the beer selection is sub par.,2.0
nothing felt authentic from the decor to the food.,2.0
"however, the service is not up to standard.",2.0
i was pretty disappointed in the beer festival.,2.0
i will try another location before i write it's off completely.,2.0
the gentleman who answered the phone was abrupt and clearly in a rush.,2.0
probably not the best way to get around the strip.,2.0
you also had to be fully clothed to order at the bar.,2.0
"we would have had soy sauce, it want on the table.",2.0
have now been twice.,2.0
"i had a to go order so, my bad.",2.0
"additionally, the service was slow and inattentive, despite the restaurant not being busy.",2.0
waiter was friendly but not polished.,2.0
but db was underwhelming.,2.0
at which time i asked for drinks.,2.0
service is friendly but the store does have the distink odor of kitty cats.,2.0
they did however say they would give us a discount equivalent to one chair.,2.0
"i've had better soul food in toledo, ohio.",2.0
i have been to a much cleaner and better burlington coat factory..,2.0
our wine was served in dirty glasses.,2.0
doesn't worth the price at all.,2.0
the service was ok but we had to ask for refills.,2.0
"finally seated, waited forever to get our drinks, as well as chips and salsa.",2.0
"the mexican hot chocolate had more flavor, not worth the price.",2.0
"second try, i ordered warm or hot toppings, hoping to avoid the ice cold taco.",2.0
"now this time, it's overcooked and the pepperoni is burnt crispy.",2.0
seems nice but dirty plates on the tables.,2.0
the paint job was sloppy too.,2.0
"the caterpillar roll was very good, but not enough to save the entire experience",2.0
all three diners were disappointed.,2.0
he was rude and just grumpy.,2.0
"food and drinks are ok, but there's better around town.",2.0
there was also only a hint of garlic.,2.0
this was a very weird experience.,2.0
waited forever for a chance to get waitress' attention.,2.0
for the prices they charge i demand better service.,2.0
"as far as being a ""spa""...",2.0
"the broth is not as fragrant, seems watered down.",2.0
"other than that, not worth the trip.",2.0
"last time i was here, it was dark, overcrowded, slippery and not fun at all.",2.0
i honestly think pita jungle is just mediocre and over priced.,2.0
the restaurant was a decent size but definitely outdated.,2.0
it was quite disappointing.,2.0
i have to say with each experience it just gets worse each time.,2.0
even at that point i was not impressed.,2.0
the waitress brought my burger with fries when i had ordered a side salad.,2.0
"the tomato jam was more like regular tomato sauce, quite disappointing.",2.0
likely wouldn't go back next time i'm in town.,2.0
the home fries were extremely greasy.,2.0
the quality of the food isn't the greatest.,2.0
"bottom line is, canadian tire needs better customer service.",2.0
there are so many better mexican restaurants in phoenix.,2.0
their only reply was that they sold wrapping paper and gift bags.,2.0
vibe is pretty good but food is definitely not worth the price.,2.0
i don't want it to be soggy when i'm on the plane.,2.0
"but, the pho broth was flavorless and really sweet for some reason.",2.0
the food was good but service is horrible!!,2.0
it's like the cooks don't care.,2.0
i dislike going here as they are always trying to up sell and are pushy.,2.0
"as with anywhere, there are nice people, and then there are not so nice people.",2.0
"the tiramisu dessert was good, but could not make up for the horrible veal scaloppine.",2.0
"overall, the service was poor and they were very rude.",2.0
"too salty, ive had better...",2.0
the ingredients were placed in the omelette like a sandwich...not actually cooked in the omelette.,2.0
"average food, terrible staff.",2.0
i wouldn't go out of my way to return.,2.0
definitely did not live up to the hype.,2.0
pasta was overcooked and soupyfried donuts were solid.,2.0
was a big disappointment.,2.0
"although i have taken people here, i do have to say that i've experienced better.",2.0
the staff needs work on customer service and making their customers feel welcomed.,2.0
probably won't be returning.,2.0
so i must continue washing dishes in the bathroom until maybe next monday.,2.0
we could've gone to a decent sit down restaurant for that price.,2.0
we didn't bother with the food.,2.0
my fiance did not care for his spaghetti and meatballs.,2.0
a lady starts to do my pedicure normal polish not shellac ok whatever.,2.0
i gave it two stars because the people were friendly and the service was fast.,2.0
coffee tasted like it had grounds in it.,2.0
lunch service leaves a lot to be desired.,2.0
the only reason for two stars is the actual building itself.,2.0
the restaurant was not very clean either.,2.0
it is expensive and as the prices go up the food goes down.,2.0
overall the lunch was unpleasant.,2.0
after this experience i'm sure the cia could use my blending skills.,2.0
or  at least until the next time i go to vegas.,2.0
i decided not to overpay and only had salad.,2.0
this place keeps going on the decline.,2.0
service was slow and not attentive at all.,2.0
the egg was too brown too.,2.0
it doesn't taste good though.,2.0
i hate to be negative but we were so under whelmed.,2.0
either something is wrong or missing almost every time.,2.0
more rice then anything.,2.0
"unfortunately, the show was just a disappointment!",2.0
""", ""the owner makes things too chaotic"", etc.",2.0
it was the most average burger i've even met.,2.0
"however, i had to give a two stars today because the horrible service.",2.0
definitely not worth the long wait.,2.0
the server was very polite and efficient but the food was less than desirable.,2.0
as far as buffets go this is less than average.,2.0
very sad as i usually have an okay time here.,2.0
"ok, we have been here a few times for breakfast, but never for dinner.",2.0
we felt like we were an intrusion on her station.,2.0
let's be honest and leave it at that.,2.0
"so, more than twice as long as anticipated...to pour a bowl of soup...",2.0
i expected alot more professionalism and much better communication skills.,2.0
"but as i walked down the line, nothing really looked that appetizing to me.",2.0
"when the food did arrive, it was cold and we didn't have any cutlery.",2.0
"not a perfect french food, great win list but too intent to look at.",2.0
"the man was nice, but he didn't apologize either.",2.0
"alas, too damn salty!",2.0
"the cupcakes themselves are hard, dry and relatively flavorless.",2.0
"expensive, tiny and leaves you wanting more and still hungry.",2.0
"but to me, the bug was large enough to indicate some carelessness in preparation.",2.0
we waited an hour for our food and it just wasn't that great.,2.0
and the other times were for alterations.,2.0
late night servers were really unprofessional.,2.0
so i wont go back.,2.0
not impressed at allservice was not good.,2.0
"nothing will wow you and everything is just adequate, if not overpriced.",2.0
customer service wasn't the greatest either.,2.0
it's hard to explain but we didn't like it at all.,2.0
it's basically just order from whatever is in front of you.,2.0
didn't bring bread or butter.,2.0
"the sauce, that was where this took a drastic turn for the worse.",2.0
"while the food was as advertised, the service was miserable.",2.0
i just don't think the food is worth the money.,2.0
"food was meh,you're pretty much paying for the atmosphere.",2.0
the layout is almost uncomfortable and haphazard in a neat and orderly way somehow.,2.0
the portion sizes were small for a mexican place and the rice tasted like cigarettes.,2.0
"and all i'm asking is clearing the plates from the tables, nothing more.",2.0
the main dishes were bland and lacking in flavour.,2.0
we both agreed it tasted microwaved and not grilled.,2.0
a very weird combination of tastes and i'd rather they just served fruit separately.,2.0
but the table and dishes that were waiting for us were dirty.,2.0
"it's just a freakin' sandwich, nothing new or innovating.",2.0
"we did not eat here so i can't rate based on food, just our experience.",2.0
"the reasons are simple, and unfortunately, like interest you don't want to pay, compounded.",2.0
the food and other waitresses were less pleasant.,2.0
meals were very bland and not much flavor.,2.0
"extremely overrated place, or the kitchen had a bad day.",2.0
so my free voucher was actually for a dollar drink.,2.0
the food was mediocre.,2.0
i had a kabob dish which was mediocre but definitely not worth the price.,2.0
slow service and when i asked for something it seemed like and unconvinced.,2.0
it's a tiny cup like for dipping sauce.,2.0
i've seriously had better.,2.0
their late night menu doesn't have that many selections.,2.0
nothing out of the ordinary or anything that would justify the price.,2.0
week option wasn't going to be that good.,2.0
"well, it's a diner, not much more to it.",2.0
"chicken kreplach soup bland flavor was more like ""campbell's chicken noodle"" soup.",2.0
the ot in east liberty is definitely overbooked.,2.0
"we got the chile rellano and the tamale plate, which was disgusting.",2.0
"the new menu items sounds so yummy, but it just doesn't deliver.",2.0
i'm surprised to see that other diners enjoyed their shwarma as mine wasn't worth eating.,2.0
"pizza was salty, garlic bread tasted like it had celery salt on it.",2.0
this place was the cheapest available and i was not impressed.,2.0
the eggplants were beyond drenched in sweet sauce and the eggplants were borderline mushy.,2.0
better customer service would have changed my entire experience.,2.0
the summer special taco al pastor was not worth the money.,2.0
"it wasn't the waitstaff or anything else, the food was just mediocre at best.",2.0
she would be better suited as a prison guard.,2.0
"in fact, will probably not go to any spa again for a long time!",2.0
i had very high expectations based off everyone's reviews and sadly was really underwhelmed.,2.0
"food is fine, service was extremely slow, almost two hours.",2.0
there was plenty of quantity but just very little quality.,2.0
anyways my biggest complaint was that the hookah was not hitting very hard.,2.0
not worth the price if you're vegetarian or vegan!,2.0
the last book i checked out of there was stuck together with crusty vintage boogers.,2.0
the two entrees were bland and the seating area left much to be desired.,2.0
"checked it out,  but not my cup of tea.",2.0
maybe an off night but i really didn't see what the big deal was.,2.0
not sure i will go back.,2.0
"this place has gone downhill, and the food i had tonight was barely edible.",2.0
"there are better, healthier options almost anywhere else in the city.",2.0
such a shame downtown ramen was much better and markham's didn't live up to expectation.,2.0
"honestly, very forgettable experience.",2.0
if surgery for the hernia would help let's do it.,2.0
i could've gotten a much better salad....just about anywhere...and probably cheaper.,2.0
the second day the breakfast came early and i wasn't awake yet.,2.0
"the beef broccoli had this odd perfumed taste to it, almost hard to keep chewing.",2.0
"that brings me to the service, in short it was substandard as well.",2.0
but i was there for the hotdog and dont think i will be back.,2.0
i came in here expecting good things.,2.0
i had the chicken katsui sandwich and it was so over cooked!,2.0
that also changed too and not for the better.,2.0
there are too many honest car washes to deal with this kind of company.,2.0
the meat on my sandwich was literally only a single chicken drumstick.,2.0
"i've had their jerk chicken with rice, again to me it tasted funny.",2.0
even the abundant sugary frosting does not save it.,2.0
i also got push back when i tried to talk to the manager about this.,2.0
at least there were blackout curtains.,2.0
"the frosting was sweet, but lacking that cream cheese flavor.",2.0
i had the potato salad side dish which was served in a small styrofoam container.,2.0
"overall, i was expecting more and was disappointed.",2.0
i didn't order the steak because a friend said their steaks aren't very good.,2.0
i don't think i'll be going back.,2.0
"however, i recently went in to have my car detailed and was less than impressed.",2.0
the caramelized sugar on top of the creme brulee wasn't even caramelized.,2.0
there is nothing special about the food here.,2.0
every item i ate was cold.,2.0
the s'mores shake was also just a glamorized dq blizzard.,2.0
"no, it was not a happy hour menu.",2.0
my deep dish came out and it was just meh.,2.0
the staff was not attentive and definitely were not interested in working.,2.0
"today, i finally saw citycenter, and i was stunned by how lackluster it was.",2.0
i'm not sure how much more notice i could've given her.,2.0
way too many other good eats in vegas to bother going back.,2.0
i haven't had good food here in a while.,2.0
"but, as far as first impressions, i did not want to eat any more.",2.0
"it was a very messy, dirty store and extremely small aisles.",2.0
"i also decided to order a chocolate eclair, which was extremely far from perfect.",2.0
the paint on the walls was chipped.,2.0
"if the brand seems like something popular or trendy, the price goes up.",2.0
maid service cut corners at times.,2.0
"the case, general storefront and bathroom were all dirty.",2.0
so it was a disappointing start.,2.0
the chicken dish was basically steamed and seasoned with salt.,2.0
and the beers are over priced.,2.0
and it was fishy tuna salad.,2.0
this particular mcdonald's needs more staff on hand.,2.0
"when it came time for the glitter, it was a disaster.",2.0
the crab legs were insanely over cooked and discolored.,2.0
the food is overpriced and the portions are miniscule.,2.0
the rice and beans were the standard fare served at every mexican restaurant.,2.0
both of us dozed off during the show.,2.0
then when the food came i had to ask for salt and pepper.,2.0
"i didn't go in, so i can't attest to the customer service.",2.0
"our experience was overall very, meh.",2.0
the broccoli and baby carrots were way too overcooked.,2.0
not the worst thing but more of an omen of things to come.,2.0
"food is not so good , place is neat.",2.0
i ordered the thai chicken on whole wheat regular crust.,2.0
it was just straight up tuna.,2.0
most subways i been to offer a restroom.,2.0
the bread was chewy.,2.0
felt like a cafeteria.,2.0
"the fries were just plain soggy, flavorless.",2.0
i've have had better at alexion's!,2.0
"le samedi et dimanche, n'y allez pas... les files d'attente aux caisses sont légendaires.",2.0
disappointing meal high priced.,2.0
"overall, the food was mediocre at best.",2.0
i ordered a passion fruit tea which probably contained half a cup of syrup.,2.0
what a let down.,2.0
"as an family classic, the food is rather disappointing for its price.",2.0
"bouffe moyenne, il faut aimer le bouillon.",2.0
i felt pretty unlucky leaving this joint.,2.0
additionally there was minimal acrobatics and a weak storyline.,2.0
i found the classes to be extremely repetitive.,2.0
not sure i want to go back.,2.0
the server was a little rude and didn't seem happy to even be there.,2.0
some of the cuts of fish tasted pretty fishy.,2.0
"the staff is amateur, and more concerned about talking amongst themselves, loudly, than helping you.",2.0
"other than that, i would not recommend.",2.0
"dark, dingy and outdated interior.",2.0
"first off, the food was very under par in my opinion.",2.0
low rating for the long wait time for two small pizzas.,2.0
i likely would never at here again based on this.,2.0
nothing was especially impressive about it.,2.0
it was so bland.,2.0
"we tried the torpedos and they were decent, however the bacon was partly raw.",2.0
do not try the calzone or try to add the extra items in it.,2.0
"bref, c'est un peu trop cher pour ce que c'est.",2.0
the size of the chicken they serve has gotten significantly smaller.,2.0
the meat was either under seasoned or not seasoned at all.,2.0
waiting tables is not rocket science.,2.0
"but.. these walnut cakes were premade from who knows when, and they were so stale.",2.0
then there was the soup.,2.0
they don't do a great job of monitoring their machines during rush hour.,2.0
the frosting was grainy and left a greasy film from all the butter.,2.0
also it's expensive and they have pretty small serving sizes.,2.0
for the price they charge the portion could be much better.,2.0
"ordered take out from here, and was really disappointed by the food.",2.0
the torta at los toquitos is hands down better.,2.0
food was ok but certainly would not come back here,2.0
"the baked cannelloni was tasty in comparison, but the meat had an unappetizing gray color.",2.0
server not very good.,2.0
"when i got in the car, however, it was not clean at all.",2.0
"wanted to like it , but just cant.",2.0
the change rooms are small and kind of gross.,2.0
but it's also not worth the amount.,2.0
the burger was overlooked and tasted mediocre at best.,2.0
shouldn't be paying a higher amount of money for a cheaper quality of foods.,2.0
"be that as it may, the food is lackluster at best.",2.0
kidsignment kind of seems like a year round garage sale.,2.0
i hate that you have to make appointments way ahead of time.,2.0
it was a shame the waiter made us feel so unwelcome.,2.0
i'm indifferent to both of those.,2.0
pumps and bathrooms are always dirty.,2.0
the food wasn't that great however.,2.0
"extremely slow service, and the food wasn't great.",2.0
ultimately not that impressed.,2.0
the food not so good this time.,2.0
even for an expensive town the prices are steep.,2.0
there wasn't any  tomato and sandwich didnt  resemble the picture on the order board.,2.0
the sock puppet routine was not funny and seemed to go on forever.,2.0
went recently  to order again and received a ground beef not so good replacement. .,2.0
"the bathrooms are horrible though, you can't hardly see anything in them.",2.0
my two stars are for the atmosphere.,2.0
"the pasta is really good, but the customer service is terrible.",2.0
i probably would not come back unless things changed.,2.0
"oh well, i don't think i'll be back any time soon.",2.0
"the waiter, brian, was dismissive and distracted the entire meal.",2.0
"sushi is good, but man, the service is completely absent!",2.0
food was lacking in salt and seasoning.,2.0
dirt and dust everywhere and light bulbs out.,2.0
"and no ventilation fan in the bathroom, that's gross.",2.0
"the rooms do not have a thermostat, so you cannot control the temperature.",2.0
"the food although acceptable, is not as good as it used to be.",2.0
the ice cream was kinda of heavy...i don't recommend it.,2.0
so it's beyond me why anyone would settle for mediocre.,2.0
"so, i doubt i'll be shopping there again.",2.0
i gave it two stars primarily because of the poor customer service.,2.0
i got to say that this place was a disappointment for sure!,2.0
don't think i'll come back any time soon.,2.0
food was bland as some said and not the greatest.,2.0
"second visit we tried the pizza, again very disappointed.",2.0
the beef tips were barely warm and very tough .,2.0
a two star rating for poor service and bland food.,2.0
"lo mein was ok, but had a strange oily aftertaste.",2.0
"i was disappointed in this place, overall.",2.0
"the prices were nice, but the selection was very limited.",2.0
the policy for shopping is unclear.,2.0
it was warm but excessively oily.,2.0
we just expected better from the high ratings.,2.0
the meat was poorly seasoned.,2.0
"rigatoni bolognese, tough and dry.",2.0
there are better places.,2.0
"maybe i'm just particular about manners, but i wasn't impressed.",2.0
i think it's overpriced and under delivered.,2.0
the food was mediocre and the atmosphere plain.,2.0
don't order the ramen.,2.0
the dessert cheesecake was very plain.,2.0
"we all had different appetizers, and they were all outrageously salty.",2.0
however i have been here twice and haven't been impressed.,2.0
"after that, it was an hour and a half until we finally ate.",2.0
"service was above average, but food couldn't make up for the decent service.",2.0
the ethical thing is to stop charging premium price for lower quality product.,2.0
i ordered the linguine bolagnese and it was not good.,2.0
this location is my least favorite.,2.0
not a good value and i won't be going back.,2.0
the service and staff were kind of bitter and not very accommodating.,2.0
she was not able to taste the actual burger .,2.0
the lettuce was brown .,2.0
my request for a refill was also overlooked.,2.0
the classic american food is really weak!,2.0
it is very pricy for mediocre quality.,2.0
when you ask a question they act like you are an annoyance.,2.0
the music is fairly loud and makes it hard to have a normal conversation.,2.0
at least the mushroom flatbread was.,2.0
"the chocolate cake was ok but again not worth the money ""dry"" .",2.0
not worth the money.,2.0
i love thier products not so much in love with thier service.,2.0
"go past sobey's to five guys, their burgers are way better.",2.0
"staff is mostly disinterested, but some are helpful.",2.0
rice had a large amount of garlic in it.,2.0
it really sucks because it has great potential.,2.0
"the green of the day, broccoli, was a very poor excuse for a side.",2.0
that would have been respectable instead of trying to intimidate you with a computer.,2.0
not sure i can muster the patience to give them a second chance.,2.0
or that the staff is hipster friendly.,2.0
"instead, we were met with distracted servers, mediocre food, and an outrageous bill.",2.0
the fries were barely warm and obviously had sat for a while.,2.0
we were definitely not impressed.,2.0
my table had to wiped down after i set down.,2.0

all and all it is not worth going back just for the food.,2.0
items were not made well.,2.0
the service was definitely subpar.,2.0
too many other places to bother stopping here again.,2.0
their bike prices are high along with all their gear prices.,2.0

"also, it smells like urine in here.",2.0
we both didn't like any of it.,2.0
"nothing special, it smells like dog food, and there's plenty of supplies...plus.",2.0
the waiters no longer strive so hard to create that one of a kind experience.,2.0
we are from out of town....so won't likely get to experience the location again.,2.0
and when they advertise bottomless fries i expect to get bottomless fries.,2.0

it was fresh however it was very plain tasting.,2.0
the manager was frustrated that we asked for a plate and silverware.,2.0
the falafel did not taste good nor was it the proper consistency.,2.0
the best example is my girlfriend is disabled and cannot sit on the hard ground.,2.0
this was the slowest... my potatoes were old.,2.0
and for that price i want something more than bad fries with my ribs.,2.0
"also, i was less than impressed with my margaritas.",2.0
we also received two orders of breadsticks considerably burnt..,2.0
my nail tech was an older man who seemed to know what he was doing.,2.0
"their ""welcome to firehouse"" greeting is weak and there is no eye contact.",2.0
there was no crispity crunchy outing that i would have expected from fried veggies.,2.0

the food was mediocre at best and took forever to come.,2.0
and hen was tough and chewy and caesar salad was terrible!!,2.0
"like how the rating says ""meh.",2.0
the food was below average.,2.0
not because of the ingredients but due to the soggy lettuce and stale tortilla strips.,2.0
then only a few of us received our drinks.,2.0
they weren't interesting or even really delicious.,2.0
really slow service for fast food.,2.0

it was mostly water.,2.0
the food is meh.,2.0
the service was adequate but i wasn't in the slightest bit dazzled in any way.,2.0

upscale doesn't necessarily equal good.,2.0
fries weren't cooked all the way through leaving large fries crunchy.,2.0
"food was not horrible but not decent either, definitley not worth the money.",2.0
quite salty and overcooked for the tofu and basil.,2.0
"however, when i got to work, there was no cream cheese, and no utensils.",2.0
these products are made by farmers and craftspeople who sweat and get dirty.,2.0
"for the latter,  visual effects are greatly diminished, as the ""magic"" is on full display.",2.0
so it was quite annoying.,2.0

"floors were kind of gross, i stepped in someone's chewing gum somewhere along the line.",2.0

quality has gone down.,2.0
the atmosphere completely ruined what could have been a good dinner.,2.0

their platter which my wife bought didn't fair so well.,2.0
"if you wait a day or two to eat it, forget it.",2.0
the bar is super tiny.,2.0
dry chicken and over cooked ribs and hard bread.,2.0
the orange chicken was lacking the sauce so i basically had dry breaded chicken.,2.0
the music played in the restaurant was like listening to a heavy metal band.,2.0

skip nobu if you've been to any other location.,2.0
the restaurant upstairs is pricey for what you get.,2.0
and dirty glasses with specs of food.,2.0
"grossed out, and won't be back!",2.0
the food was ok.the service was very bad.,2.0

this being on many different occasions.,2.0
c'était vraiment gras je me suis sentie mal ensuite et écoeurée.,2.0
numerous better places to eat in the area.,2.0

used to be my favorite greek place but not anymore.,2.0
"now that the food is not satisfactory, i see no reason to go back.",2.0

"like another reviewer said, it didn't seem like the house was being cleaned.",2.0
"also, it is over priced",2.0
water spilt all over the floor when i picked up a bunch of celery.,2.0
this will be our last visit due to the slow service and food issues.,2.0
they were plain and mushy.,2.0
"however, when i picked up my order the pants had pleats.",2.0
this place is mediocre at best.,2.0
missing that sour balance and very disappointing.,2.0
the staff also didn't seem to maintain order and let kids own the place.,2.0

it was not worth it.,2.0
it took a very long time to get her attention while sitting at the bar.,2.0

nevertheless they aren't ours.,2.0
"the whole atmosphere came off as a tacky attempt at ""hipster"".",2.0

egg drop soup also had no seasoning.,2.0
the only saving grace was the talented karaoke singers.,2.0

sofa isn't any better.,2.0
pretty bland and unimpressive.,2.0
the size of the bowl was small and the char siu pieces were small too.,2.0

"for a special meal, or for sushi prepared with care, go elsewhere.",2.0
"the furniture, unfortunately, is probably the original stock brought in at opening!",2.0
"oh, and another annoying thing is that you can't get beer at the tempe location.",2.0

it was not seasoned well.,2.0
it's a noisy place that they squeeze too many customers in bar area.,2.0
"the food was expensive for something basic, nothing special.",2.0
this was the first of many disappointments of the evening.,2.0
"i went there and ordered from the lunch special menu, which is very limited.",2.0
instead she could of said ok would you like something else instead.,2.0
"ok, i guess i'm not your target.",2.0
and i think it outweighed the chicken.,2.0
"the crust was likewise bland, dry, and not flaky.",2.0
overpriced mediocre food...save your taste buds and wallet!,2.0
it was quite disappointing.,2.0
"""sorry"" seemed to be the waiters mantra.",2.0
only reason two stars is that other people in the party liked the burgers.,2.0
got their signature burger and it was meh.,2.0
they try to look fancy but the quality didn't match up.,2.0
both the quality and variety were not up to par with the other buffets.,2.0

"that's not a deal breaker by itself, but the food is average at best.",2.0
the waitress seemed annoyed that i asked a question about the beers.,2.0
so the four slices are paper thin and see through!,2.0

the food is not nearly as good as it used to be.,2.0
my dining companion commented that it felt like a cafeteria.,2.0
"still, it wasn't badly made, not old, just cold and with.. icky buttercream.",2.0
neither the communication or follow through was anything like the past.,2.0
it has so much potential!,2.0

my first two visits to this place was not good.,2.0
"sushi selection is large, but ingredients seem poor and stale.",2.0

i waited awhile for the gel manicure.,2.0
the harmarville location is notably worse than the strip district location.,2.0
"however, the nurses here and the assistants were awful!",2.0
the bathroom floor tile is nice but so uncomfortable.,2.0
not one person in our four person party was wowed by their meal.,2.0
so dissapointed lately with this place.,2.0
service is the only reason i am giving two stars instead of one.,2.0
"the meal came with a toast of bread, which does not make culinary sense.",2.0
my caesar salad was bitter and the dressing was almost tasteless.,2.0
"poached egg, piglet bacon, creme fraiche, salsa verde, harissa, cheddar all over a baked potato.",2.0
"oh well though, maybe she had a rough day.",2.0
the service isn't stellar either.,2.0
seems like the roof is falling apart downstairs.,2.0
seems like this place could do a lot better food quality wise.,2.0
i didn't see what all the hype was about this place.,2.0
"had the baked shrimp, pretty dry.",2.0
downsides outweigh the up for this place.,2.0

the links were over cooked to the point that they were mushy.,2.0

"all in all, the predictable quality you expect from these sorts of places.",2.0
lobster roll was flavorless and underwhelming.,2.0
"wasn't horrible,  wasn't good either.",2.0
my experience here was not the greatest!!,2.0
"the drinks were mostly juice, little alcohol.",2.0
qdoba down the street has way more menu options and much nicer staff.,2.0
big problem was that i did not look at the menu before booking.,2.0
don't think there will be a fourth visit...,2.0
but we aren't driven to go back again.,2.0
i'd recommend the smittys nearby right next to walmart on mcleod trail instead.,2.0
"it wasn't the food, not at all.",2.0
we would have ordered more and spent more had the service been acceptable.,2.0
we weren't the only ones either.,2.0
this is not my kind of food.,2.0
pizza was super greasy too.,2.0
", however i wasn't given cutlery or a napkin.",2.0
you hear airplanes and outside noises a lot.,2.0
i've had better burgers off job site food trucks or at a county fair.,2.0
"extremely short wait times, the moment you ordered, the food came out shortly after.",2.0
just a disappointing experience overall.,2.0
"sadly, i don't think that's the case any longer.",2.0

the server was bad too.,2.0
the gentleman that did my pedicure seemed very preoccupied with what was on the television.,2.0
"it was small, kinda messy and the floors looked dirty.",2.0
our office orders takeout from here frequently.,2.0
also i'm pretty sure the chicken they put inside it was just quickly microwaved.,2.0
"heavily breaded, and not much crab really not what i expected.",2.0
"if you crave doughnuts, any polish bakery or dunkin donuts would be a better option.",2.0
"in my opinion, i think this was done so he can charge the mandatory gratuity.",2.0
"ok, the chips were ok. first time and the last too.",2.0
the country fried steak was like shoe leather and that's an insult to shoes everywhere.,2.0
well now i know... rice it definetly not this place's forte.,2.0
it's a shame cuz i would order their gyros more often.,2.0
then the cashier let more people cut in front.,2.0
"it won't succeed with prices this high, same as those restaurants before them.",2.0
"for a place that is suppose to have superior barbecue, i got to say... blah.",2.0
i mean the place was empty so i would hope it would be.,2.0
"also, the inside of this place is dark and dingy.",2.0
the buffalo cauliflower was undercooked florets coated in red hot and kraft blue cheese dressing.,2.0
the bun tasted a little stale too.,2.0
it is only for people sitting at the bar.,2.0
two stars because the fried rice was pretty good.,2.0

the fries were extremely greasy.,2.0

"sloppy, greasy, overly sweet and cold.",2.0

higley location needs to get its act together.,2.0
it seems like they didn't know what they were doing.,2.0
this was really lacking.,2.0
"malasadas were cooked in the same oil as the fish, so they tasted pretty shrimp.",2.0
even the kid's mac and cheese was bad.,2.0
i suggested putting another soap dispenser there so it didn't run out.,2.0
the spaghetti it came with was nothing special.,2.0
another issue i have had is the declining caliber of cleaning i am getting.,2.0
super weird and uncomfortable.,2.0
"was very disappointed in my experience here, and our waiter was not so great.",2.0
the service took a while even though there were only a few customers.,2.0
but the four cheese grilled cheese on brioche toast was not good.,2.0
"nothing fresh at all in any way, except the chips and salsa.",2.0
basic customer service retraining would be a good idea.,2.0
the only redeeming thing was the chicken gizzards.,2.0
both times i walked out disappointed.,2.0
"if you want decent food, go somewhere else.",2.0
there was no line in the drive through but yet the service was still slow.,2.0
"it's a ""cute"" place but i don't think i got my money's worth.",2.0

"however, i always find myself giving them another chance and regretting it afterwards.",2.0
i really don't get the hype about this place.,2.0
"grandma's kitchen.............it looked like grandmas kitchen, but didnt feel like it.",2.0
don't think i'll return again.,2.0
this is not the montreal steamy experience.,2.0
the store employees always seem unhappy.,2.0
"someone rated this as, ""bottomless will keep your glasses full.""",2.0
i can probably count all the customers here on my two hands.,2.0
wrong rice was brought and had to be exchanged for our ordered brown rice.,2.0
"was expensive even with ""half off.""",2.0
the pasta that came with it was also disappointing.,2.0
"the chicken was  an odd cube shape, and minimal.",2.0
"all in all, i spent a full hour to get one signature.",2.0
guess it wasn't so that his hands were sanitary.,2.0
"however, my recent experience at the restuarant really threw me off.",2.0

portions are less than half sized.,2.0
i want to use companion certificate.,2.0

the food itself wasn't bad the service on the other hand was awful.,2.0
the katsu was soo dry and it was all batter and pretty much no chicken.,2.0
i wouldn't go back.,2.0
there are better choices in this area of scottsdale.,2.0
"looks cute, but is pretty bad.",2.0
i do mind spending that much when the food is not prepared properly.,2.0

i hated sonic food in general.,2.0
"also, no kosher pickle.",2.0
i didn't see what the hoopla is all about.,2.0

even the bun was a little burnt.,2.0
probably won't be coming back.,2.0

probably won't go back.,2.0

"the food is expensive, but could be worth it.",2.0

yang chow fried rice was worse.,2.0
i was pretty disappointed in their lack of professionalism.,2.0
i'm giving two stars because the host and manager were very friendly.,2.0
"i don't see their employees wearing hair nets in the kitchen, maybe they should.",2.0

"the chicken was overcooked, and the salad was pathetic.",2.0
the pizza is great but the service is really really bad.,2.0

can't really say anything about their services.,2.0
too overpriced for what it is.,2.0
not sure if it was a language barrier issue or they just didn't care.,2.0
perhaps the only saving grace was the passable beer menu.,2.0

"i didn't understand this, because walmart.com delivers to their store.",2.0
but the worst part of my experience was the patrons.,2.0
the second beer we ordered was even worse with the wait time.,2.0

you're better off going to robertos taco shop for the quality of the food.,2.0
i told her i'd have to reschedule because i frankly am picky about my pedicures.,2.0
unfortunately the apples were spongy and some of them had gone bad within a week.,2.0
you'd think the takeout bag would come with a napkin and plastic ware.,2.0
"after that she ignored our table, which was hard to do in an empty resteraunt.",2.0
the service is slow.,2.0
wife got a grilled chicken chimichanga and said it was plain with little flavor.,2.0
been there numerous times and used to be real good.,2.0
my experience here was really disappointing and did not meet my expectations.,2.0
"i went here for my sister's birthday, and it really went downhill.",2.0
it took a while for boxes where i had to pack my own.,2.0
"maybe their dealer can't get something you want, but i assure you other places can.",2.0
luckily my little nephew went to washroom otherwise it would spilled on him.,2.0
lately though the food quality has taken a bit of a turn.,2.0
just bland and cheap if you're on a budget.,2.0
it's not as...personal or intimate anymore sad to say.,2.0
the fries were too little and in general the typical lame lv restaurant.,2.0
"presumably, other rooms will have plumbing in better condition.",2.0

i tried the baked wings and i'm not a fan.,2.0

it wasnt what i was hoping for and definitely not dark enough.,2.0
this place is overrated by a long shot!,2.0
my scum bag radar was beeping constantly.,2.0

nothing special or authentic tasting to me.,2.0
appointment scheduling seems to be somewhat of an issue more frequently than not.,2.0
"my friend and i both ordered beers from the menu, they didn't have either.",2.0

"service wasn't great, food was average, price is way above average.",2.0
then the chavs moved in and it went downhill.,2.0
"the chicken is tough, the curries are a bit too sweet...",2.0
i've definitely had way better.,2.0
and the food lacks consistency.,2.0
maybe they did the demographics and the neighborhood poeple don't mind spending the extra buck.,2.0

i just didn't really appreciate the experience and will not be visiting again.,2.0
pas un expirience très positive à ce resto.,2.0

i was highly unimpressed.,2.0
every time i get her she takes forever to do a very minimal job.,2.0

very cold to watch a game in even buy usual local  rink standards.,2.0
mediocre italian style food.,2.0
"i am willing to wait for something extraordinary, but snooze just isn't it.",2.0
don't think we'll be returning anytime soon.,2.0
i didn't get the type of manicure and polish i asked for.,2.0
certainly low in the value category for a low rent area.,2.0
i haven't been back since after i discovered that they enclosed the patio.,2.0
i didn't not like it and felt anxious for the horses.,2.0
low quality bitter coffee mixed with hot water at premium price.,2.0

don't think i'll be back.,2.0
and their service isn't that great.,2.0
"nice location, pretty bad service ...",2.0
it was bland and i felt like i was basically eating fried bread.,2.0
no hustle in her step.,2.0
maybe from someone else's plate.,2.0

service is usually not great.,2.0
"with all the hype, i expected better.",2.0
"when asked about the crispy chicken our waiter said, it's terrible.",2.0
i wanted to like this place.,2.0
come here if you want snobby steak.,2.0
first experience and it was not the worst.,2.0
"food may be good, but they are now off my fave list.",2.0

look elsewhere for better service and grub.,2.0
today was my turn to get to order something different.,2.0
then another hour for our food.,2.0
"the catch was, there were only two soft drinks...",2.0
this hotel is in need of a serious downgrade on ratings.,2.0
we probably won't be going back.,2.0

they have much nicer workers there who are willing to help.,2.0
i wish the food was the same.,2.0
"i've been here a few times, and wasn't too impressed.",2.0
service overall struck us as a bit amateurish.,2.0
their coffee is a small step above starbucks.,2.0
i don't think it's that's great.,2.0
too much spanish here.,2.0
two stars because of the hair and not at least a discount or an extra.,2.0
the green curry dipping sauce was insanely spicy with no tang or flavor.,2.0
equipment is terrible and old.,2.0
"a salad that was ordered was so loaded with dressing, it was overpowering.",2.0
i was not overly impressed with this place tonight.,2.0
"the service is not bad, but slow.",2.0
some steakhouses have better seafood.,2.0
"not real machaca, just plain ol' shredded beef, that is not machaca.",2.0
"the ""oaxaca"" sauce that accompanied them tasted strangely like bottled american salad dressings.",2.0
staff were superfriendly but that doesn't make up for a disorganized kitchen,2.0
better restaurants in the venetian,2.0
disappointing onion rings and undercooked burger.,2.0

this place needs a huge makeover!,2.0
i had the veal and i did not care for the way they prepared it.,2.0
"eh, not much to them.",2.0
but they really need to be better organized.,2.0
music was strangely loud for such a small and mostly empty restaurant.,2.0
a paucity of cream cheese.,2.0
the food was ok and cheap but took forever to come.,2.0
you wait the same time whether you have an appointment or not.,2.0
the tortillas are hand made but not fresh tasting.,2.0
we finished with a cream filled puff pastry which was rather dry and uninteresting.,2.0
"the service was okay, the wine was good, the food terrible.",2.0
i also tried a bite of my friends florentine crepes which i thought tasted bland.,2.0
they took it back with the irreverence it was served with.,2.0
the babaghanoush was nothing great too.,2.0
ordered food only here before going to undertow.,2.0
the bathroom toilets look like they haven't been cleaned in a decade or so.,2.0
what threw me off was that they can do their burgers 'medium'.,2.0

the interior is nice but food quality is nowhere near similar places like mucho burrito.,2.0
our dishes also did not come with kettle chips as indicated on the menu.,2.0
raspberry stuffed french toast was yucky except for the real raspberries on it.,2.0
virtually no broth just noodles and nice sized carrots.,2.0
i have had better food at places cheaper than this.,2.0
bought a couple cupcakes.,2.0
the first time i wanted to try their pizza but the oven was broke.,2.0
probably it was unwise to host an outdoors event in march.,2.0
not bad but certainly not worth the time.,2.0
it it was overpriced and underwhelming.,2.0
my biggest complaint is their rude receptionist.,2.0
the beds are very hard... repeat the beds are very hard.,2.0

it seemed way overhyped for the experience in the end.,2.0

i was told they had done a face lift and it was more modern.,2.0
all the soda was room temperature.,2.0
get a beer instead.,2.0
left feeling not quite satisfied and overstuffed but a cheap meal nonetheless.,2.0
"should have known by that, that the experience would be about the same.",2.0
the second time we decided to get chimichaungas.,2.0

"other than that, there's no reason to go.",2.0
the server was nice but it's just so boring there.,2.0
"it was a reddish pad thai, which i have never seen.",2.0
"i didn't think it was possible for sushi to be boring, but this was.",2.0
it was almost as if i ordered a plate of chips with a side sandwich..,2.0
caffeinated coffee is also bad for my heart and for my eye pressure.,2.0
"for the price they charge, it's simply not worth it.",2.0
and the quality of the meat was mediocre.,2.0
i wouldn't recommend ordering channa masala and muttor.,2.0

makes things extremely uncomfortable.,2.0

it was also uncomfortably loud.,2.0
this is what i would expect mexican food to taste like in canada.,2.0
about the same as hometown buffet quality.,2.0

we chalk this up to only one thing.,2.0

i don't know about you but that's too expensive and the food wasn't even great.,2.0
"food was ok, but extremely expensive for being average.",2.0
there has to be another nearby option under different ownership.,2.0
they used to have the best selection of tools.,2.0
the quality of their food is a shade of what it used to be.,2.0

"the service was fine, but certainly not fine dining quality.",2.0
"very watery, not enough flavor, lack of veggies.",2.0
expensive and not worth it.,2.0
i've been there multiple times and at first my expectation was low.,2.0
little pricier than earls but no where near the calibre of food or service.,2.0
got the order partially wrong.,2.0
six plain cookies were provided and half were overcooked.,2.0
food was mediocre at best with little flavor.,2.0
still i go back no and then to see if it's better.,2.0
"the restaurant is dated, not clean and disorganized, giving an unwelcome feel.",2.0
they were not very helpful in coming up with a solution to fix it.,2.0
blah blah blah what's all the hype about.,2.0
but experience is dime a dozen.,2.0
food quality has gone down hill as well.,2.0
this dive bar is totally overrated.,2.0
what if the light was on.,2.0
once we were seated we had to ask twice for silverware.,2.0
"the spring rolls were most definitely not ""fresh""..",2.0
probably won't come back.,2.0
i would still prefer other sushi places over this.,2.0
the employee who happened to be working wasn't super friendly either.,2.0
the carpets in the rooms and hallways are old and don't look or feel clean.,2.0
waited an hour to get in and i expected a lot more.,2.0
the toast often burnt.,2.0
the fish taco had way too much lettuce compared to the other ingredients.,2.0
the small cob used to be full of avocado.,2.0
"also, my boss' samosa was cold.",2.0
"pomegranate serves up mediocre renditions of iranian favourites, complete with waitresses wearing ""free palestine"" bracelets.",2.0
"the price is great, but the service sucks.",2.0
seriously i'd  rather eat in and out burger any day.,2.0
"unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.",2.0
we felt like we were bothering him.,2.0
the spicy yellow tail rolls were also dry and very very fishy!,2.0
thru didn't know answers to simple questions.,2.0
the selection here isn't really that good and there are broken items on the shelf.,2.0
very slow and just not my type of place.,2.0
my expectations were not that high.,2.0
food quality reminded me of a cheap attempt of trying traditional chinese dishes.,2.0
"the last two times i've gone in, the roasted veggie salad was pretty much raw.",2.0
i would rather pay a couple of dollars more for better food.,2.0
the quality of food definitely dwindled down.,2.0
"this place, by comparison, is sloppy.",2.0
i have definitely changed my spending here at this store.,2.0
i ordered the crazy alfredo and my pasta was literally swimming in oil.,2.0
the aisle signage really needs to be fixed.,2.0
too loud to have a work meeting.,2.0
had trouble getting a server to bring us drinks....,2.0
but honestly i don't think it'll be any time soon.,2.0
"nothing was terrible at this place, but nothing was great either.",2.0
this is why i don't really write reviews on food that i'm not familiar with.,2.0
"as others have written, there isn't much ambiance.",2.0
not up to four points standards.,2.0
two stars only for onsite lab.,2.0
the prices were lower than expected.,2.0
the food was bland to say the least.,2.0
je n'y retourne pas,2.0
"i thought they would be happy that i brought in business, but service was marginal.",2.0
the staff was very inattentive and dazed.,2.0
honestly any bar type restaurant makes way better fajitas!,2.0
way too spicy for what was ordered.,2.0
the pickled veggies were thick and did not taste like they were truest pickled.,2.0
i ordered the chimichanga and it wasn't my idea of what it should of been.,2.0
based on the shape of the patty it seemed to be a frozen patty.,2.0
pretty disappointing brunch experience.,2.0
my ac stopped cooling and they came right out but estimated repairs very high.,2.0
her attitude today left a lot to be desired and we were overcharged.,2.0
"the food no complaints here, a glass a water eww more like the faucet water.",2.0
"although the staff were very polite and courteous, i will not be back.",2.0
"other than that, it was unremarkable.",2.0
so my reception to this store is lukewarm.,2.0
drink selection was subpar especially for a place named lager and vine.,2.0
"our waitress was nice, but i'm pretty sure she brought me the wrong beer.",2.0
"again, the sushi was good, but overall it just wasn't a great experience.",2.0
but recent visits really disappointed me.,2.0
otherwise it's just meat on toast.,2.0
"the ""pierogies"" were canned biscuit dough with, well something, inside.",2.0
it didn't combine well with the goat cheese and spicy pecans.,2.0
"i'm not sure if it was an off day, but service was definitely lacking.",2.0
waited forever for her to take our credit card.,2.0
too much competition around town to go somewhere they made me angry.,2.0
too much traffic for the hot food and a very poor selection.,2.0
"should have known better, but it's just your standard frozen, chewy breaded clam strips.",2.0
i don't think i've ever paid so much for an ordinary cappuccino before.,2.0
the variety is nowhere near what they say is on the website though.,2.0
most of the stuff was very overpriced.,2.0
"poor service, decent food, good location.",2.0
just that this place is nothing special whatsoever.,2.0
i love beans but their beans i did not.,2.0
food is overrated and under portioned for the price.,2.0
i ordered a moroc bowl through ubereats and overall was pretty disappointed.,2.0
what i got instead was the saddest salad i've ever seen.,2.0
"if you're in the area, i'd recommend going to claim jumpers instead.",2.0
"service is normally fine, but the place is always dirty and hot as hell.",2.0
the place was not busy so unsure what caused them to be so unorganized.,2.0
"the eggs had no seasoning what so ever, super bland.",2.0
way overpriced and the food is very bland.,2.0
"first, i found it extremely overpriced for the portions that i got.",2.0
the portion is way too small compared to other location.,2.0
won't go that route again.,2.0
room service would have been a better idea.,2.0
i would pay more and go to a similar venue in town.,2.0
"sad to be reviewing becketts so low, but was highly disappointed with the experience.",2.0
"cool decoration, cool concept, but why the food is not good .",2.0
water or tea is self serve.,2.0
the only app notable was the souffle of sorts.,2.0
"keep in mind i got just ice cream itself, no waffle or cookies or toppings.",2.0
so the nail employees had drama going on while i'm getting my nails done.,2.0
the bar tenders were far from professionals.,2.0
"the service was really slow, and not at all good.",2.0
it is not like this is a large kitchen and the order gets misplaced.,2.0
"however, once we were seated, our waitress implied that our food would be coming shortly.",2.0
"the mashed potatoes we not hot, barely warm and the salad nothing special.",2.0
there are no amenities in your room only a refrigerator.,2.0
the sushi was grocery store grade and the desserts were not fantastic.,2.0

the blender is as loud as an airplane engine to your face.,2.0
our waitress was all over the place and it was hard to get her attention.,2.0

that did not bother us at all since the weather outside was so nice.,2.0
"the waitress sided with the cook, until i insisted that medium rare still meant cooked.",2.0
"next, they had piles of chicken and it all looked great.",2.0
the food was mediocre.,2.0
the menu is tiny.,2.0
"ok italian, but way too expensive!",2.0
low end furnishings and mediocre bar service was not what we expected.,2.0
not the best place for burgers or to eat at at all.,2.0
"i understand different chefs have different interpretation of what is ""medium"".",2.0
i got the tortellini and it was gross.,2.0
"with so many other chain options in this price point, we won't be back.",2.0
the delivery has always been timely although the deliverers themselves seem rude often.,2.0
why aren't you on top of your minimum wage tips...,2.0
"i used to enjoy coming here, until i had something stolen from me here.",2.0
"maybe two slices of meat, and a single slice of cheese.",2.0
not much meat on them.,2.0
we went late so both of our first choices were not available.,2.0
the service is slow.,2.0
no more...and we used to come here and lot...food baaad.,2.0
"we ordered the calamari for an appetizer, which was mediocre.",2.0
the sashimi in my combo today was thinly sliced with little to no fish flavour.,2.0
i will most likely not revisit due to the hefty price of my drink.,2.0
the seasoning isn't all that appetizing either and doesn't compliment the meat.,2.0
the rooms left a lot to desire.,2.0
two of us had the falafel salad which was mostly chopped parsley.,2.0
it really isn't necessary.,2.0
it wasn't busy but it took a very long time to receive our food.,2.0

other than that everything else sucks.,2.0
hardly any mashed potatoes and barely any gravy on the steak or potatoes.,2.0

i had four different tacos and i thought they were all sub par.,2.0
i was unimpressed this visit.,2.0
service was very slow for us but if you come often you get served faster.,2.0
fries were basic krinkle cut fries.,2.0
i'm honestly afraid to go back.,2.0
"the burger wasn't anything special, i could have made it  at home.",2.0
didn't have the heart to order our desserts on the tablet.,2.0
"great atmosphere, way over priced!",2.0
maybe their sweet crepes are better.,2.0
the food is mostly tasty but way voerpriced for the quality.,2.0
the cheese fries has way too much cheese.,2.0
it tends to be the most expensive gas around.,2.0
every kind of sushi we ordered basically had 'california roll' in it.,2.0
two stars because the waitress was at least friendly.,2.0
"it's unfortunate because the food was decent, but the bad outweighed the good.",2.0
the food did not look like the photos posted here.,2.0
it's terribly crooked and they used a totally different color of thread.,2.0
but i have to be honest...for sushi i was very disappointed with the serving sizes.,2.0
"after twisting their arm, they comped us for a partial breakfast.",2.0
there was no reason our apps should have outpaced our very simple drinks we ordered.,2.0
very tough and super salty.,2.0
"after today, that will be the last time i eat there.",2.0
for an appetizer we shared the calamari which was very bland.,2.0
i think this place is overrated.,2.0
i ordered the surf and turf sandwich and it lacked any flavor or seasoning.,2.0
his ribeye had been marinated to complete chewiness.,2.0
"staff are not very friendly, not that much of choices.",2.0
we came here on a friday night and were annoyed from the beginning.,2.0
it's basically a glamorized cost cutters.,2.0
more often than not there is always something that makes the experience less than desirable.,2.0
"great looking decor, but bland food and wait staff that is unhelpful.",2.0
"but, the service at lunch today was crap at best.",2.0
we seriously ended up spending too much time there.,2.0
i also ordered extra vegetables and got some bean sprouts and cabbage almost no broccoli.,2.0
definitely not one of my favorite clubs in vegas.,2.0
for the last few years it has not met the standards.,2.0
"vegas is already expensive, but this place was expensive even for vegas.",2.0
"for the price, it's definitely not worth it.",2.0
it was more like fruit juice.,2.0
"for some reason we had two waiters, one to ""back up"" the other one.",2.0
enchilada in green sauce were nothing special.,2.0
"the fries were the best part, but you don't go here for the fries.",2.0

not a good combo.,2.0
i ordered the pasta primavera and it was so bland.,2.0

"fries this time around weren't very fresh, which aggravated me.",2.0
"i guess two stars says ""meh.",2.0
they have almost no tequila selection at all.,2.0

"the sliders were ok, but the bun was stale and gross.",2.0
"i got the mozzarella sticks which were edible, but again, nothing to rave about.",2.0

i order the cobb salad which was subpar.,2.0
the food is ok the price is to high for what it is.,2.0

the place looks clean but the constant smell is gross!,2.0
the sides are very limited.,2.0
either way it's not the great it once was.,2.0

the only reason for two stars is the service!,2.0
"this was just for lunch, i can't even image how much dinner would be.",2.0
they slipped several times and i wondered if they were damaging the wheels.,2.0
there wasn't much variety.,2.0
carne asada nachos were a huge disappointment.,2.0
"not going back here, too many other options to choose from in the area.",2.0
very average chinese food heavily sauced with corn syrup and corn starch.,2.0
food and drinks were way overpriced.,2.0
"other than that though, not much about this place made me want to come back.",2.0
a tiny place with an unimpressive atmosphere.,2.0
"but, the style's are just plain.",2.0
pay attention when eating.,2.0
and that would be ok if the food was any good.,2.0
the packaging caused some pretty serious sogginess after the first layer was consumed.,2.0
this hotel is slightly below ok.,2.0
we are entertained by the theme but extremely annoyed by the service.,2.0
and the hamachi dish i ordered wasn't fresh.,2.0
it doesn't matter if the quality is amazing if the experience doesn't even come close.,2.0
not my favourite of craft stores... but it does the job at times.,2.0
there are much better options in town for good thai food.,2.0
not that impressed with this place.,2.0
there was very little fish in there to speak of.,2.0
"pretty poor breakfast offerings, the one toaster was broken.",2.0
both wife and kids were not impressed and not one of us finished our food.,2.0
"i just had a feeling that i was a hassle, and not welcome at all.",2.0
the only reason i have given this place two stars is because of the price.,2.0
they just taste canned...a few spices go a long way.,2.0
"the interior of the restaurant is not that old, but it has been horribly maintained.",2.0
all in all an average place however i would not go again.,2.0
sorry squeeze in won't be back.,2.0
seems more like a cheesy restaurant at a theme park.,2.0
the execution and taste were simply bad.,2.0
the cobb salad was a disappointment.,2.0
"overall, just didn't have the energy and execution that i was accustomed to.",2.0
all in all the place felt like a university bar trying a bit too hard.,2.0
"food is ok, and the service was awful!",2.0
"although there were a couple of vegan options, none of them were tolerable.",2.0
"most of the staff were friendly, but one just plain ignored us.",2.0
not worth the money.,2.0
the prices are high and the servings are very large.,2.0
used to be my local bar with friendly staff.,2.0
"this was my first time at scaddabush, and probably my last.",2.0
"signature beef noodles and soup bland and tasteless, not good taiwanese beef noodles.",2.0
felt like i owed her a fortune,2.0
with sushi it just tastes off.,2.0
and i really wanted to like this place.,2.0
they don't speak english much at all either.,2.0
this was our first time and it was not great.,2.0
i probably wouldn't visit it a second time unless the food gets better.,2.0
there was a bunch of fruits flies just flying over our food and drinks... ewww.....,2.0
service is super slow and they are just indifferent to your needs.,2.0
just an overcooked pile of fries.,2.0
the low turnover means that your sushi will not be very fresh.,2.0
waitress was nice but very forgetful and took forever to get anything.,2.0
our food was overpriced and honestly not that good.,2.0
"otherwise, the food was a few notches below airport or mall chinese food.",2.0
carpeting in hallways were filthy.,2.0
"the food is fine, but boring and very overpriced.",2.0
the quality of the ingredients was also questionable.,2.0
the veal sandwich was soggy.,2.0
i cannot believe how much is still there after getting a pedicure.,2.0
adelaide street pub is a loud bar.,2.0
but i won't be returning here or any other for a long while.,2.0
ordered some general tso's and was disappointed.,2.0
cause fresh lobster at another chinese mart is more reasonable.,2.0
jerk chicken was mediocre...spicy but nothing memorable.,2.0
"the fish was fishy, nachos or sth was not hot or warm enough.",2.0
"however, when i tasted it, i immediately detected the taste of plasticy bottled lemon juice.",2.0
"wore down, old furniture and dirty carpet.",2.0
not the worst but have had better.,2.0
the sides of rice and beans weren't that good either.,2.0
we weren't made to feel especially welcome.,2.0
sometimes they forget ingredients.,2.0
maybe they should be reported to the health department.,2.0
your hot sauce selection is unrivaled.,2.0
after paying what i did and seeing what i did i felt disappointed.,2.0
"small portions of food, small drink portions, and the service was just below average.",2.0
"well, the desert were totally bad.",2.0
"recently, the quality of the food and service has gone downhill very, very fast.",2.0
tater tots were just ok. not worth the money.,2.0
the caprese benedict came on brioche that wasn't toasted making it bland and cold.,2.0
"we have been here twice, trying various dishes and have yet to find anything exciting.",2.0
"the food was passable, but not great.",2.0
"they weren't bad, just not in a hurry to help anyone.",2.0
rice wasn't the broken rice.,2.0
it was ok food but it made us a bit sick.,2.0
not much in the mood for anything or anyone.,2.0
"there were sooo many employees on the floor, looking confused, running into each other.",2.0
been there so many times you would need a calculater to sum it up.,2.0
but... in reality poutine shops only have one thing to do.,2.0
the food is alright but it is not worth the time or price.,2.0
it was probably rushed.,2.0
the heating for the individual pots are sporadic at best.,2.0
"the food was meh, not horrible, but just kind of bland.",2.0
"however, food was below average.",2.0
i am not picky at all but this was not a positive dining experience.,2.0
lots of wasted space out front.,2.0
both family and i felt bloated and fighting for a bathroom trip each time.,2.0
they lost all of the originality and character of the original mission at this location.,2.0
probably wouldn't choose to go back.,2.0
"the service wasn't exactly great, either.",2.0
the one i had was oily.,2.0
"yet, after getting service, food, and drinks things were better.",2.0
i don't understand the excitement about this place.,2.0
but this place i didn't really find anything worth remembering.,2.0
"however, when i decided to bring my boyfriend, it went sour.",2.0
"over priced, food was less than fair tasting.",2.0
low on taste and definitely high on price.,2.0
this last visit was pretty sucky.,2.0
it's definitely no authentic bbq.,2.0
"one thing about the trunk space, no ac!!",2.0
the waiters and waitresses are rude.,2.0
i ordered that trout and the fish was cold and sausage was dry !,2.0
"while i like famous faves, i would not return to this location.",2.0
i've been there a few times and am always disappointed in the service.,2.0
"as it was, staff outnumbered customers, about a dozen of each.",2.0
these weren't even fancy fries made with fresh potato pieces.,2.0
you guys were way understaffed and unable to handle a morning coffee crowd.,2.0
the rest of my experience wasn't quite as pleasant.,2.0
probably won't come back here again.,2.0
"unfortunately, the cooking part didn't come close to a home cooked meal.",2.0
edamame is way oversalted.,2.0
the beef in the beef and broccoli was too thick.,2.0
"it's very pricy for a tiny hotdog, i was expecting a size of a sausage.",2.0
"however, after today's visit i can only give it two stars.",2.0
chicken was dry and the burger had too much onions on them.,2.0
"first of all, we weren't expecting a fast food place in a mall.",2.0
tried and several times.,2.0
"let me tell you, it is overhyped.",2.0
it is not the best.,2.0
"in each case, i've found the food much blander than i expect from mexican food.",2.0
the cigars are pretty damn near dried out.,2.0
but i just wasn't feeling it either.,2.0
was so excited until i tried the cannoli.,2.0
efficient but grumpy service....and everyone where small black toques for some reason....weird uniform.,2.0
but i didn't bother tipping because i was disappointed at the food.,2.0
quality varies from poor to mediocre.,2.0
midget spring roll was also overcooked and heavy.,2.0
"oh, and i asked for guacamole and it never came.",2.0
"the tableware, thankfully, was clean and the food plates appeared to be as well.",2.0
chicken in salad is over cooked and not seasoned.,2.0
all i could taste after only finishing half the order was salt!,2.0
wasn't very impressed with the food.,2.0
"sound quality, was okay the first night but pretty bad the second night.",2.0
it did not have much flavor and was nothing really special.,2.0
"each time i eat there, the quality of the food and the service have deteriorated.",2.0
not sure i will visit this location again.,2.0
have definitely had better fusion.,2.0
"after all the hype around it, i expected something more.",2.0
also there famous cheese sizzle platter not the greatest either.,2.0
many are covered in tatoos and they just walk around talking to each other.,2.0
our waitress asked if i cared to order anything else..,2.0
go to the mills or waterfront instead.,2.0
this location should update their equipment or at least have it serviced.,2.0
several other tables were served before ours and the service was cool and indifferent.,2.0
they could've at least offered us a seat until they were ready.,2.0
the customers seem to be getting more trashy.,2.0
"eh, my fiancée and i tried granite city and were disappointed.",2.0
"unfortunately, this restaurant did not live up to its hype.",2.0
"the table ""action"" is lame.",2.0
not exactly the vegtables i was thinking of.,2.0
i probably will not be returning.,2.0
it was super soggy.,2.0
adults without small children and teenagers will likely be bored.,2.0
just don't expect much.,2.0
best thing that could be said about it was that it was cooked correctly.,2.0
i love irish pubs and was very disappointed with this one.,2.0
had the stir fried pork with black bean and it was underseasoned.,2.0
won't go back for services.,2.0
i should have demanded a jacket with a better fit around my arms.,2.0
tried to see if we could change rooms but front desk not very helpful.,2.0
they seem to have better looking items in their website.,2.0
my nubbin of a sausage was overcooked and slightly burnt.,2.0
"i wasn't expecting gourmet food this spot, but it was flavourless.",2.0
there is absolutely nothing exciting about their signature margaritas ...,2.0
the atmosphere  has completely changed.,2.0
fish  of the day was unimpressive and the accompanying salad had wilted greens.,2.0
we wanted to try something new.,2.0
every time i go in i am always disappointed.,2.0
"had the chili rellanos, was not very good, tasted like a giant cheesestick.",2.0
the servers act like you're bothering them most of the time.,2.0
this is not the good egg!.,2.0
with so many choices around i will not be coming back.,2.0
no ... there's too much choice in the market place.,2.0
my boyfriend and i used to love this place.,2.0
took too long for someone to take my payment at the window.,2.0
"the instructors are ok, but i've had better.",2.0
and it's over rated and over priced.,2.0
"barely any fruits, vegetables or seafood.",2.0
not enough country style gravy for the steak.,2.0
"when we arrived, we couldn't check into our hotel because housekeeping was behind.",2.0
i really wanted to like this place but somehow it managed to fail my expectation.,2.0
i don't think we'll be going back.,2.0
the biggest reason i wouldn't come back is the service.,2.0
breakfast was ok but no offer to refill coffee cup.,2.0
the sandwich was equally bland with nothing but roast beef between three dried up waffles.,2.0
was supposed to be some of the best pizza around.,2.0
i've been not impressed with nail color chipping off.,2.0
but the food was only so so.,2.0
the burger was okay but the waitress was not very nice.,2.0
the atmosphere of the restaurant has nothing special and turned down my appetide even more.,2.0
it was stuffy and dirty.,2.0
the food was very average and somewhat over priced.,2.0
"the base tastes like it has been defrosted, or stale.",2.0
and that was the end of the prompt service.,2.0
didn't care for the pork which normally i love pig over beef.,2.0
the fried chicken was barely browned and the chicken was greasy.,2.0
sounded interesting but bottom was completely burned and overall just wasn't that good.,2.0
the quality of the food has really taken a turn for the worse.,2.0
the music blaring was pounding techno.,2.0
"zucchini, sweet potatoe, and regular fries.",2.0
the waitress looks a little grumpy and inpatient.,2.0
the salespeople are still helpful but apparently not to everyone.,2.0
the same salad i had last time was now drenched in oil.,2.0
i do not think i will be going back to this place.,2.0
especially the seafood tanks.,2.0
i've had their crab leg special and crab cakes and wasn't impressed at all.,2.0
when you get offered bread and then get charged for it.,2.0
the food quality was very average.,2.0
but service at this location .,2.0
the chorizo was super greasy and had the look and texture of taco bell meat.,2.0
most likely won't be back.,2.0
didn't smell like fresh bagels.,2.0
only reason we didn't send back was because we had a show to get to.,2.0
"being treated poorly, however, isn't worth another dime from my pocket.",2.0
over priced for the amount of food given.,2.0
sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment!!,2.0
for fish eggs they use food colouring and the rolls are pathetic!,2.0
"however, the vegeterian options are very limited and the food is extremely salty.",2.0
looks like i'll have to find a new burger place for my lunch breaks.,2.0
went here to look for a couple shirts and maybe a pair of shoes.,2.0
and it is overpriced for the meal you eat.,2.0
decor was dusty and dirty in the bar.,2.0
have brunch at bistro la bon and avoid this place entirely.,2.0
simple things make greater impacts on your customers.,2.0
it was an hour 'till we got our food and then it wasn't hot.,2.0
"i thought it would have pieces of cheese cake in it, but nope!",2.0
happy hour should be regular bar liquor selections at a reduced price.,2.0
as always tonight the food was good but the service was terrible.,2.0
our nachos were disgusting.,2.0
"my husband loved all the ""reproduced"" music memorabilia but i am largely unimpressed.",2.0
"once we ordered, she seemed to disappear.",2.0
the seven other tapas we ordered weren't much better.,2.0
the corn fritters were very small.,2.0
"like i said, good stuff in there but unwelcoming, at least from my personal experience.",2.0
the only reason i go there is because i live nearby.,2.0
in any case they are nothing special and i definitely don't recommend them,2.0
"much less cost for a more effective wash, dry and detailing.",2.0
the service was super slow.,2.0
pizza was largely lacking flavor and undercooked.,2.0
i really don't  feel they know what they are doing.,2.0
mais malheureusement il y en avait pas.,2.0
honestly the diner had a very cold and unwelcoming vibe.,2.0
onion rings were served soggy.,2.0
don't think we'll go back.,2.0
just because they're laminated does not mean it's disinfected.,2.0
there are better options especially in scottsdale.,2.0
"it looks like a scrap book,, but the service was not good.",2.0
they tasted like ordinary fries to me.,2.0
service was slow and not very friendly.,2.0
the paella which the waitress said was really good was not good at all.,2.0
disappointing but i guess the new owners didn't think it was economical.,2.0
i'm giving this two stars because the food is good.,2.0
the soup was egg drop it was very pale and had no taste.,2.0
"anyway, the service was good but the food was not.",2.0
"beer selection was modest, and the food was pricey for the quality.",2.0
"other locations, not so much.",2.0
not the same at all anymore.,2.0
the portions are small and for the price they should be bigger.,2.0
i used to spend christmas with my husband before he left.,2.0
i could probably make better at home.,2.0
my friend ordered over easy with sausage and her eggs were hard.,2.0

went here late at night for a cocktail and was sorely disappointed.,2.0
"the place seems like a local hot spot, but i wasn't terribly impressed with it.",2.0
let's just say we won't be coming back.,2.0
"no smile, no ""thank you,"" no ""have a great day,"" nothing.",2.0
you're a burger joint and the burgers suck every time i've been there!,2.0

"to start, it took way too long for the waitress to take our orders.",2.0
"the second time i had my underarms done, i think i was burnt.",2.0
"nothing terrible, but nothing really good either.",2.0
i notice that their portions are less and price are higher than before.,2.0
it definetly seemed like she didn't care.,2.0
the bartenders weren't personable and very standoffish as well.,2.0
the hotel is in serious need of a remodel.,2.0
it was not even a busy time.,2.0
"two stars for the staff, none for the food!",2.0
the chicken was surprisingly dry and not spicy.,2.0
i wouldn't call that satisfactory.,2.0
the front office staff is not so great.,2.0

"got rice at the end of meal, tasted like portage.",2.0
"it felt very touristy, very much like it was designed by committee.",2.0
"when she went back to preparing food, she never changed her glove.",2.0
it's a burger place and the burgers were just not good.,2.0
if wasn't that fast and didn't taste that good.,2.0
"a less than grand opening, unfortunately.",2.0
i was disappointed because they over advertised this place.,2.0
"the food was marginal to disappointing, once again not the caliber to expect.",2.0
i was disappointed with the service.,2.0
not at all impressed.,2.0
spa was broke down most of the time.,2.0
everything else was bleh...,2.0
the buffet looked old and dried out so we decided to order off the menu.,2.0
it seems as if every employee there would rather be somewhere else.,2.0
just not impressed and won't return.,2.0
the cost for either was not compatible with the portion.,2.0
and that they must have added even more salt when they were sending it out.,2.0
atmosphere is cool but food wasn't very good.,2.0
the food on the happy hour menu is lackluster at best.,2.0
the pico de gallo was flavourless.,2.0
i found both the fish and fries it to be heavily dripping with grease.,2.0
sushi isn't the greatest.,2.0
"i guess if i pay a fine dining price, i want a fine dining experience.",2.0
it seemed he was just bored and didn't show any excitement about his job.,2.0
"i may give longhorn another try, but not at this location.",2.0
service could be better.,2.0
"hence, the two star rating.",2.0
neon blue lights on brick is not my idea of a cool dining room.,2.0
"probably won't return, as there are too many fabulous choices in vegas!",2.0
really quite mediocre thai food.,2.0
the lettuce wraps were average.,2.0
the east side store is vastly disappointing.,2.0
i used the restrooms when i was there and they were dirty.,2.0
the place seems unsanitary.,2.0
shop looked kinda rundown and outdated.,2.0
fries are no better than average.,2.0
mini bundt cake tasted dry and old.,2.0
with all the hype i was expecting a lot more.,2.0
it just made it uncomfortable to keep ordering.,2.0
so we sat there for how long waiting for our other order.,2.0
ok we get that...but when a customer comes in you stop stocking and help them.,2.0
added chicken on my cobb salad and it was pretty tasteless.,2.0
the food was mediocre and not really worth the hassle.,2.0
i had high hopes for the quality but i was disappointed.,2.0
we go back to have it again and it's bland cold and barely edible.,2.0
"maybe they were understaffed, but everything seemed to take forever.",2.0
one slice of that yummy pork just didn't cut it for me or my hubby.,2.0
"the atmosphere is decent enough, the service is often lacking.",2.0
food i ordered was below average.,2.0
came for a burger...not impressed.,2.0
"my meal, which was potatoes and brisket was overly salty.",2.0
"but you can do far far better in vegas, skip this place.",2.0
but the portion size is tiny for the astronomical prices.,2.0
we were unable to have a proper conversation the last two times we went.,2.0
the person waiting on us didn't seem to want to work there.,2.0
quality and slection of dishes are very mediocre.,2.0
i wasn't too impressed with the flavors since they were so limited.,2.0
and the bun the use is huge and tasteless.,2.0
"def going elsewhere next time for ayce sushi, knowing there's better out there",2.0
no need for me to return.,2.0
"however, we had some very bad service from our waitress.",2.0
i would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland.,2.0
"we didn't get pho, to be fair, but the bun cha gio was bleh.",2.0
staff isn't very tentative.,2.0
"overall, a massive disappointment.",2.0
i want to try another style but when i look around she wasn't there.,2.0
two stars only because the staff was friendly.,2.0
it's certainly not something i'd order again.,2.0
we only ate lunch and perhaps the dinner menu has better offerings.,2.0
"if i do venture back here, i'll order some actual pub grub and not pasta.",2.0
"admittedly, poodles are harder to groom then a lot of dogs.",2.0
bland and mushy and messy.,2.0
"the koolaid was just stupid sweet, like dummy sweet.",2.0
"there is 'crowded' in a good way, 'packed', 'overpacked', and 'fire hazard dangerous'.",2.0
the dumplings are decent but the service is incredibly slow.,2.0
took over a month to recieve.,2.0
disappointed they don't honor the lvac discount like the southwest location.,2.0
"the soup, of course, is not the milky broiled soup.",2.0
there is a lot better out there.,2.0
that is why i will give a second star.,2.0
i tried cashing out at the supplements but they were just playing with their phones.,2.0
the bad part about the trip is the driver.,2.0
we waited a long time for salads and  over an hour for entrees.,2.0
"your laksa is not laksa at all, it's definitely not asam laksa...",2.0
the prices here are high for the portion size.,2.0
the trout was underseasoned with a very weak sauce.,2.0
it was really salty and quite spicy for my palette.,2.0
"i have nothing to say about the beer, but the food was not really good.",2.0
the food is good but the customer service is awful.,2.0
maybe takeout would be better to not have to deal with slow inattentive service.,2.0
"if the payment was equivalent to a drink amount, that would be fine.",2.0
"it's appropriate that they're located on bland st, because the food was virtually flavorless.",2.0
my wife had a black bean burger that was lukewarm and flavorless.,2.0
twice we've ordered and both times something was missing.,2.0
"thankfully, they did not charge me for the steak.",2.0
the waitress forgot the kid's orange juice and only noticed it when asked.,2.0
this place is just incredibly noisy because of the cheap construction.,2.0
staff ranges from frazzled to aloof to couldn't care less.,2.0
the price was not what i was told it would be.,2.0
but the food is mediocre at best.,2.0
two of the three dishes i've had here were really greasy.,2.0
the food here is decent but the service sucks!,2.0
"with so many other asian places nearby, i wouldn't recommend trying this one.",2.0
"i was, sadly disappointed.",2.0
maybe today was an off day...,2.0
the grilled squid was not hot and had too much sauce on it.,2.0
our waiter was pleasant although not sufficiently trained.,2.0
this is a below average sports bar.,2.0
too many other options in vegas...,2.0
the quality has also degraded.,2.0
don't think i'll be back.,2.0
"so, i just feel screwed.",2.0
i only shopped here twice and both times the wait was just stupid.,2.0
now for the rest of the night...our miso soups tasted...odd.,2.0
we went there for valentine's day and unfortunately the whole thing was a mess.,2.0
a noticeable lack of customers on a recent visit for one.,2.0
lunch by myself took an hour.,2.0
hope the food is better than the service.,2.0
the pizza is worse than some frozen types.,2.0
i'd rather spend a little extra and go to dilly's or rinaldi's.,2.0
it tastes sweet which is not how i want my pho to taste.,2.0
it was so loud we had to shout over the table to hear each other!,2.0
i needed to take it back and then everything was properly addressed.,2.0
"but now, not so much.",2.0
we used to come here and lot..no more!,2.0
not enough vegetarian or vegan options.,2.0
it was stingy on prosciutto and the mozzarella was a little rubbery.,2.0
"once we got our food, i asked for a refill on water..",2.0
unlikely that i will do that anymore.,2.0
the garlic chicken was cold and the flank steak was chewy.,2.0
my husband got the grouper....again nothing like the description and not worth the price.,2.0
the reason for the low score is that we did not enjoy the food.,2.0
i think it could be a happening place if their service and food was better.,2.0
then the rest of our good trickled in.,2.0
"no tables, just a counter and a bench.",2.0
i love the food here but the service is terrible.,2.0
ordered drunken spicy noodles.,2.0
"""my delicious food isn't what i ordered.""",2.0
we were not impressed with the front desk.,2.0
"for an appetizer we had the calamari, which on it's own was very ordinary.",2.0
i doubt i'll be back.,2.0
"they are way too skimpy on the toppings, seriously.",2.0
for my money i would much rather go to habit burger.,2.0
"great friendly service,  but it didn't make up for the tasteless food.",2.0
"could see employees inside, but the ignored me.",2.0
it doesn't have to be.,2.0
only redeeming quality is the desserts.,2.0
we were starving afterwards.,2.0
"food may be convenient, but service and training are certainly lacking.",2.0
not impressed with jacquie.,2.0
this is the slowest dairy queen.,2.0
i was very disappointed in the price of the drinks.,2.0
i'll be going anywhere but the unremarkable bean.,2.0
the deserts were not very good either.,2.0
"hype, food sucks, the atmosphere is kinda cool though.",2.0
i think the right word for rrbc is forgettable.,2.0
"the draft beers shrunk in size, as did the food portions.",2.0
loud and inappropriate music.,2.0
i don't get the hype.,2.0
this place is continuously getting more expensive but he food is not increasing.,2.0
"alaska, you can do better.",2.0
i wouldn't go here unless you really can't miss the band.,2.0
first trip to the new location and am hesitant to ever go back.,2.0
"so i used to love this place, until i noticed their unsanitary practices.",2.0
my nail beds were not pushed down to make my nails look nicer.,2.0
"sadly, service is not as good as food.",2.0

the food on the other hand was nothing to write home about.,2.0
the marsala sauce was not like any we had ever seen.,2.0

"and what part of ""no pickle"" do they not understand.",2.0
"nothing was excellent, while somethings were below standard.",2.0
"when the george lookalike began singing, we looked at each other with wth expressions.",2.0
i haven't even eaten yet and i'm not too impressed.,2.0
they came lukewarm and i felt like they were either loaded with salt or msg.,2.0
the palms has slowly been going downhill for years.,2.0
one of the slowest locations.,2.0
"the girls were nice to look at, but nothing more.",2.0
the clerks at the platis shop were always disinterested when i complained.,2.0
"had high expectations from the reviews, was disappointed.",2.0
it came out very over done.,2.0
"they completely missed the middle console, where the cup holders and gear shift is.",2.0
i was expecting way better food based on the reviews.,2.0

i feel bad for them having to work alongside that guy.,2.0
all in all i was not very impressed with pink and white lotus nail salon.,2.0
been to better pho places.,2.0
"he did state up front that the ""high"" quality screen had a year warranty.",2.0
the only saving grace were the chips and salsa.,2.0
overpriced good old boys club for baby boomers.,2.0
guac was nothing special.,2.0
two stars for the nice people working there.,2.0
the tacos were starkist tuna with seasoning at market price.,2.0
i wouldnt recommend this place for the price point.,2.0
"overall, disappointing experience, have had many friends tell me how much they love it.",2.0
the sauce was plain and the toppings overcooked.,2.0

this place was a disappointment.,2.0
"they were strictly meat, cheese and onions.... that's it.",2.0
"they used to have check in kiosks, not anymore.",2.0
both tasted very watered down... very.,2.0
i don't think it is worth it.,2.0
after the appetizers the meal kind of went downhill.,2.0
we sat for over an hour before our appetizer came.,2.0
the customer service however was pitiful.,2.0
the point is they need to better train there people.,2.0
and this place is unfortunately on the lower rungs.,2.0
the service is slow!,2.0
this location needs more training of entire staff.,2.0

medium steak here equals well done any where else.,2.0
"decent food, terrible service.",2.0
"although the perfect apt doesnt exist, i would recommend looking elsewhere.",2.0
it also gave me stomach issues the next day.,2.0
perhaps this is done to try to accommodate an american palate.,2.0
they fool you with a bunch of toppings choices.,2.0
i think the wait staff either needs training or maybe hire a few with experience.,2.0
the casino is packed and the smoke smell is awful.,2.0
not the bold flavors expected of a celebrity chef.,2.0
the sauces were bland and boring.,2.0

"glad i tried it,  but there are definitely better italian eateries to choose.",2.0
"basically, you are paying for the atmosphere and fancy cutlery.",2.0
"the earl has gone through several transitions, and many changes in chefs to boot.",2.0
may be due to serving hoards of poor tipping elderly.,2.0
it kind of left a bad taste in my mouth...,2.0
"when you go in there, it's truly something new, old and different all at once.",2.0
wings were over cooked and dried out and sauce was mediocre at best.,2.0

the chair was way higher than the table making it awkward to eat.,2.0
then my pizza was cold and my husbands food was still doughy.,2.0

the room was old and quite dated.,2.0
don't think we will be coming back.,2.0

and the service has gone down also.,2.0
the resort is beautiful but the service was terrible.,2.0
dip was good but the chips were old and the oil had gone rancid.,2.0
the beans it came with were not really seasoned either.,2.0
"the toppings were blah, the crust was nice.",2.0
the waiter was also hard to get.,2.0
i wouldn't order the sandwich again.,2.0
"i usually eat anything, but this i did not eat, it was cold.",2.0
their service is good but i don't think i will be back to this.,2.0

i had to add salt.,2.0
"margarita was nothing special, but massive.",2.0
the ribs were basically flavorless.,2.0

"food is nothing special, tastes like every other chinese restaurant that i have been to.",2.0
"bit of gristle on the chicken, and too much sauce, without much flavor.",2.0
it's been about five minutes.,2.0
it wasn't what we thght .,2.0
je n'ai rien trouvé d'extraordinaire.,2.0
"my girlfriend used to love trois brasseur, until they recently changed the menu.",2.0
"simply in comparison to others i've tried, these were not great.",2.0
i honestly don't see why people like this place.,2.0
"my garlic parmesan chips were under cooked, not crispy at all, and way over seasoned.",2.0
that's because i got a french tip instead of getting my whole nail painted.,2.0
the portions on the other hand... ridiculous.,2.0
the seating area is way too wide for the stage.,2.0
one large table of guys were way overserved on cocktails.,2.0
"in addition, i specifically requested areas be worked on and they weren't.",2.0
samosas and pakoras were cold.,2.0
there are far better burgers to be had in toronto,2.0

maybe they should redo this whole einsteins.,2.0
i expected jamerica's food to be as bright as the restaurant's colorful facade.,2.0

"heard great things about this place, but it definitely didn't deliver.",2.0
the pizza itself was greasy and fairly untasty.,2.0

no regular equipment maintenance and pool was not being brushed.,2.0

"oh, and it didn't come with any sauces for the fried shrimp.",2.0
dumped bbq sauce on it .,2.0
overall average food and tired service.,2.0
"you guys can defiantly do better, just saying.",2.0
the first time had it served with no sauce at all.,2.0
"the pancakes, biscuits and gravy are all average at best.",2.0
being cash only was also inconvenient.,2.0
would consider returning if friends wanted to go though.,2.0
you won't see me here again.,2.0
it was waaaaaay salty.,2.0
"secondly, about the time our food arrived, the restaurant was completely filled.",2.0
the two cooking were too busy talking to each other to notice what was needed.,2.0
inside of glasses being wiped with dirty towels then filled with drinks.,2.0
they were having air conditioning issues and the restaurant was hot.,2.0
"not only was she grumpy and seemingly scowling, but she wasn't very helpful.",2.0
watch out or you'll overpay!,2.0
and the pizza was half the price there.,2.0
"please, ladies, reconsider scheduling a party here.",2.0
tried a sampling of other's food and it was similarly lackluster.,2.0
turkey sandwich with hardly any turkey.,2.0
if you are average height you need to stoop to see out.,2.0
my rolled tacos where super soggy and left much to be desired.,2.0
food is substandard and the service is too.,2.0
especially in vegas are so many other better choices.,2.0
"additionally, the animals sounded stressed with the amount of barking, yelping, and whining.",2.0
"unfortunately, we didn't feel either lived up to the hype of the article.",2.0
used to come here semi often until they got new management a few years back.,2.0
the pricing at this place is over rated.,2.0
"i.forgot to say, we didn't get our food yet",2.0
tons of them on the escalators.,2.0
i don't know if she was just bad or management really need train better.,2.0
this place is slow.,2.0
the quality of the chicken isn't that great sometimes.,2.0
"i'll stick to better prices, wider selections, and less ""selling the sizzle, not the steak""",2.0
waitress watched while we unfolded the napkin from the silverware and dried off the table.,2.0
"the food was decent for the price, but the service was horrible.",2.0
the portions seemed skimpy and the potatoes were plain.,2.0
this spa needs to be updated!,2.0
wait staff at least weren't overtly rude.,2.0
ordered one and it was anything but hot.,2.0
that was not the case.,2.0
i had the lamb vindaloo and it was borderline watery.,2.0
"with the steep prices and paid parking, can't see myself coming back any time soon!",2.0
the concept is great but the execution was flawed!,2.0
hasn't improved much since my last visit a few years ago.,2.0
and the service is pretty atrocious.,2.0
and it turned out badly.,2.0
"if you have the choice, go somewhere else.",2.0
i can get over bad coffee and loss of a pastry.,2.0
but our waitress wasn't effective and made sure that we paid for her error.,2.0
there was way too much rice on all the rolls and the pressed sushi.,2.0
"the server we had was nonchalant, not very attentive.",2.0
i think my pasta was overcooked.,2.0
will not be back here for a long time.....,2.0
but these days it's just not very friendly.,2.0
ordered spring rolls and its saggy.,2.0
the only problem was the food.,2.0
definitely not a fine dining experience.,2.0
the gym is really small too.,2.0
"that being said, we were still disappointed.",2.0
not very good for the price.,2.0
"the two times i was here, she cut more than i asked for.",2.0
but i can not fairly rate them any higher.,2.0
the sliding of chair legs is annoying and loud.,2.0
unfortunately they're overpriced and the bartenders aren't the friendliest.,2.0
not cool pizza rock.,2.0
the atmosphere was a complete disappointment and we probably won't return.,2.0
i have stray eyebrow hairs all over that should have been waxed or tweezed.,2.0
restaurant on site is meh.,2.0
i think they used to be a lot better a few years ago.,2.0
it was just a cake.,2.0
it's a shame because this place used to be really great.,2.0
besides a good wine selection the food is nasty and over priced.,2.0
"the chicken stripes were quality chicken, but, so dry, they needed a dipping sauce.",2.0
very short and too expensive!,2.0
"place has things, but not everything we needed.",2.0
i love the other location but this one consistently blares neil diamond.,2.0
waitress had an excuse why we couldn't get ice for ice tea.,2.0
"wasn't too pleased about that, but i let it go.",2.0
but food wise..be aware its yucky and it cost more than it should have been.,2.0
kfc or popeyes has better chicken and more flavor.,2.0
the chicken pad thai tasted like fish and was bland.,2.0
it looks like the leftovers after a weekend of wedding bouquets.,2.0
"then, when we needed additional items, the girl who brought our food couldnt understand english.",2.0
not worth the price for the ok food and terrible service!,2.0
it explains the empty dining room.,2.0
the bacon was so hot that the styrofoam was burnt.,2.0
the aurora location has a boring bar atmosphere.,2.0
but the office staff and opticians are not good at this place.,2.0
dessert tried too hard and failed to impress.,2.0
i don't think the food was worth the wait or the price.,2.0
i went in expecting traditional real chinese food.,2.0
my shrimp scampi with pasta was super salty.,2.0
"if your looking for excellent food for an affordable price, look elsewhere.",2.0
i had to add ketchup.,2.0
had to keep pouring the foam off to fill.,2.0

soup was bland and egg foo yung was missing bean sprouts.,2.0
the onion straws were greasy and limp.,2.0
i probably won't be back.,2.0
didn't like my ice cream.,2.0
bland and overly processed food.,2.0
my wife had a burger that was nothing special.,2.0
the buffalo chicken wrap was bland and kind of grody.,2.0
besides the carbonara the dishes were very dry.,2.0
i was not overly impressed.,2.0
"i had to order something different, which was the steak meal, steak had no flavor.",2.0
of course we still needed sauce so we tried to get her attention multiple times.,2.0
shrimp and grits aren't suppose to be a ladled level of grease.,2.0
and the dessert was just not up to par.,2.0
our server was more concerned with getting off her shift early than working our table.,2.0
just feels like i'm eating at denny's and paying twice as much.,2.0
the noodles itself was dry and stuck together like dough.,2.0
something tells me the microwave is working overtime in the back.,2.0
the food is just ok and the service is horrid.,2.0
"however, i don't think i will be back.",2.0
"plus she seemed irritated the whole time, and just wanted to rush through the appointment.",2.0
"not sure if i'll return and if i do, it wont be for food.",2.0
i gave the two stars because of the pizza only thing warm on this buffet.,2.0
the place was empty.,2.0
"when we asked for new plates they were still dirty, and same with the cups.",2.0
anyways i'll just talk about my rice experience here which was not so great.,2.0
the only reason why we chose to stay here was because of the affordibility.,2.0
we waited a while before guy asked us our drink order.,2.0
"lots of screaming kids, old fashioned air conditioning in the room and no blackout curtains.",2.0
the food was the biggest disappointment.,2.0
so we gave the new location a try and we are just not a fan.,2.0
i was willing to try anything to make it taste like a proper steakhouse steak.,2.0
my mum said her burger seemed pretty overcooked.,2.0
it needs new struts in the front and new shocks in the back...,2.0
the only good thing about this dining experience was the actual taco.,2.0
"i don't recommend this show, especially for the price of the tickets.",2.0
the inside smells and is very dark and gloomy.,2.0
soggy sandwiches which were made out of white bread!,2.0
not a very pleasant view even if we were cows.,2.0
the guy making the ice cream was super slow.,2.0
"to be brief, i was disappointed.",2.0
"overall, below average experience.",2.0
it has been slow and innattentive on both occasions.,2.0
my medication wasn't important nor was my comfort.,2.0
"we came here to enjoy a great meal, however this manager ruined our experience.",2.0
only reason we got our entrees is because we threatened to leave.,2.0
there was no flavor to the rice but oil.,2.0
it is overpriced and not fresh.,2.0
main concerns here include that my wife and two kids don't.,2.0
just not the best pizza.,2.0
"ordered the steak sandwiches... someone received ""well done"" instead of ""medium rare"".",2.0
fries were underdone and just... meh.,2.0
not even the scent that they pump into the atrium could fight that.,2.0
"since that means the ""locals"" probably know something you don't.",2.0
super disorganized and the waitresses definitely lacked communication.,2.0
ordered turkey was very dry.,2.0
"however, the service was very slow and not very great for the price you pay.",2.0
"first server was rude, second was much better.",2.0
both times the food was below par.,2.0
there are better sushi places for the same price.,2.0
the lady was very friendly but the food just doesn't measure up.,2.0
the food seemed to be uninspired and lacked flavor.,2.0
"okay buddy, ashes to ashes dust to dust.",2.0
the food was mediocre.,2.0
i don't see the big deal with this place.,2.0
obviously not as big... but this place is really small.,2.0
super disappointed mostly with the service i received.,2.0
everyone who's mentioned the dryness and overpricing is right.,2.0
it's a nice range but the prices are ridiculously high.,2.0
the wings are anemic and the rest is adequately prepared.,2.0
cash will only be given back to the original purchaser.,2.0
first of all i don't like the whole individual pot thing.,2.0
my entrée was lukewarm when it was finally served.,2.0
kitchen very slow to get food out.,2.0
it looks weird and it tastes weird!,2.0
not a good sign when the lobster roll is flavorless.,2.0
i gave two stars instead of one because my blueberry moscow mule was delicious!,2.0
this place is nothing special!!,2.0
"the server seemed nice, though ill informed and overburdened with customers.",2.0
did not check to see if there was enough sealant.,2.0
"the room was dirty with mysterious stains on the floor, couch, and curtains.",2.0
it's always down or cash is unavailable!,2.0
the chicken in the enchiladas was dry.,2.0
crazy how mexican influences tend to corrupt the kitchens of other cuisines in this state.,2.0
other dishes are completely regular and less than expected.,2.0
"staff doesnt greet u and is always changing, messy and dingy store.",2.0
"if you're not here to play pool or snooker, you're probably better off elsewhere.",2.0
"this nellies lacks the pizzazz of a ""good"" brekkie place, like galaxie or red's.",2.0
"however, the food is disappointing.",2.0
i also hit my leg on the corner of the step up to their booths.,2.0
menu looks better than the food taste.,2.0
"and it was tiny, served in a small bar glass.",2.0
"the rice and beans were super salty, and the pork was just nasty.",2.0
at least the service was friendly.,2.0
"bearing in mind the lesser quality, i found the prices to be quite high.",2.0
they drenched it with dressing which made the sandwich soggy.,2.0
the quantity of food was more than sufficient.,2.0
if you don't have the most basic skills of waiting on people.,2.0
i would probably go somewhere else unless i was right in the area.,2.0
i got enchiladas and the chicken was dry with the sauce way too salty.,2.0
our table lacked attention and we had our entrees served way to late.,2.0
it's no fun eating your dog in the heat and wind.,2.0
i went to this salon in a pinch for a pedicure and gel manicure.,2.0
the kitchen area is dirty.,2.0
"the dj's playlist was good, but ravello was a dead zone.",2.0
was extremely unimpressed with the food and atmosphere.,2.0
the menu pricing is misleading.,2.0

bland fries and sparse toppings for the burger.,2.0
"i had the vegetarian roll, all the ingredients seemed old.",2.0
the chop suey was dry and lacked a true flavor to it.,2.0
place is not really clean,2.0
more like the employees are just here to hang out with each other than work.,2.0
"prices have gone up, flavor has gone down.",2.0
the atmosphere was great but the food was not great at all.,2.0
the bathroom is a downgrade from a travel lodge.,2.0
the slushy gimmick isn't worth going to this bar more than once,2.0
"for how long the wait can be, i'm not impressed.",2.0
"the service was terrible, and for the most part the food was mediocre.",2.0
our next clue should've been when the bread arrived...still frozen in the center.,2.0
"didn't stop me from eating it, but just plain old bleh.",2.0
both times food was less than flavorful but not horrible.,2.0
this place was not that great i'm better of going to panda bear express .,2.0
the rest really just is not awesome food.,2.0
even if it is two stars in my opinion.,2.0
that's fine we both said and proceeded to order two seafood dinners.,2.0
"ushers, they will most likely hook you up with better seats.",2.0
surely they can invest in some pint glasses.,2.0
the drink we ordered yesterday didn't taste right so we asked about it today.,2.0
"fries were ok, but burger was a big disappointment.",2.0
"and they won't do a pourover if they're busy, which was disappointing.",2.0
"service was sloooow, as with most places in nc.",2.0
and it was supposedly a spicy option.,2.0
i do not feel they truly look out for the pets best interest.,2.0
i was very displeased with the consultation here.,2.0
not a good place for watching calories.,2.0
"also, i've had the duck in paris and it was just not the same.",2.0
the container was mostly filled with rice and a tiny bit of meat anyways.,2.0
"in fact, the only nice people there were the bartender and the omelet chef.",2.0
"i love donuts, but this place has been a disappointment,",2.0
"since then, the quality of their services has gone way down.",2.0
the servers don't wear polo shirts or any type of uniform either.,2.0
the skates there look as if they have been in use for many years.,2.0
"the soup is spicy and overly salty, reminding me of the one some loblaws have.",2.0
everything else is pretty mediocre and flavorless.,2.0
not to impressed with this hotel.,2.0
la nourriture était correcte mais sans plus.,2.0
under salted and tasteless.,2.0
i'm done waiting this long for something i can get elsewhere faster.,2.0
not at all what i was expecting.,2.0
"while shopping there, i felt like an unwelcome visitor in someone's home.",2.0
i prolly wont eat there again.,2.0
the oscar style was cold crab meat with luke warm asparagus in a cream sauce.,2.0
i don't think that we will be back.,2.0
"actually was more like a subpar, overpriced experience.",2.0
i'll pay the extra few dollars and go around the corner for supplies in future.,2.0
there was nothing special.,2.0
the waitress who finally noticed us and seated us seemed very distracted and rushed.,2.0
that unfortunately was the nice part of an otherwise stressful experience.,2.0
not very seasonal and not suiting the fish dish ordered.,2.0
"the excalibur buffet has been revamped, but the food is just mediocre.",2.0
menu not impressive either.,2.0
two stars because the coffee was good and parking was easy.,2.0
"i don't think i'll go back, even though it's the closest to my house.",2.0
"different, i wouldn't suggest it.",2.0
no shopping or fun nearby either.,2.0
one waiter is definitely not enough for a busy place.,2.0
"functionally, these guys are more scottish than middle eastern!",2.0
overall i don't think we'll ever go back nor could we recommend it.,2.0
the calzones were also really wet themselves.,2.0
hopefully this won't happen again.,2.0
the food was mediocre but definitely compares to denny's status with a marked up price.,2.0
they are using half the amount of cheese and the pepperoni has gotten thinner.,2.0
"for what we paid, i'd rather get two orders of starbucks frappuccino.",2.0
"however, recently the service has become very slow.",2.0
another time there was no soap at all in the locker room.,2.0
"i ordered side salad with caesar dressing,  got a caesar salad, no big deal.",2.0

"if you're looking for good sushi, go elsewhere.",2.0
our waitress was on the slow side but it didn't bother me.,2.0
not sure why there wasn't consistency.,2.0

i wasn't a huge fan of the sauce.,2.0
such a let down when you actually taste it.,2.0

tasted like cheese whizz.,2.0
way too long of a wait for some bland mac n cheese!,2.0
my coworkers did not enjoy their burritos due to them being dry.,2.0
if you're going to serve small portions then it had better be super tasty.,2.0

"i ordered a lobster soup, and it was way too salty.",2.0
"it was, like the donuts, dried out.",2.0

her whole body language and demeanor was so condensing.,2.0
"small, overpriced portions and not very good food.",2.0
"for the cost, i expected a bigger selection.",2.0

"i""d suck their sauce from a pile of leaves, and still give it two stars.",2.0

now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place.,2.0
our waiter was extremely casual and friendly but we barely saw him all evening.,2.0
within walking distance to better burritoed food options.,2.0

"maybe this place has growing pangs, maybe it's destined to be a failure.",2.0
"the waiter was not knowledgeable on the food or the wine, and was rushing.",2.0
everyone that was waiting seemed to be annoyed at how long everything was taking.,2.0

don't eat too much guac if you don't want to diarrhea.,2.0
the food was not interesting nor was it really good.,2.0
polite staff couldn't make up for all the missteps.,2.0
grooming looks like a little hole on the wall and training isn't really present.,2.0
just not what i wanted.,2.0
the potatoes in the dish were good but the rest of it was not.,2.0
"plus, there are virtually no power plugs and limited seating available.",2.0
maybe and i mean maybe i will return some they took it off the bill.,2.0

"everyone was extremely happy with the meal, but the service was absolutely awful.",2.0
the food took much longer than it should have to arrive.,2.0

such potential...please fix your sunday brunch as i would love to be a regular guest!,2.0
i didn't finish any of the three.,2.0
the sagnaki cheese was overwhelmed by the taste of liquor.,2.0
i would probably recommend you go to another dealership for service.,2.0
nothings worse than subpar sushi and a steep bill.,2.0

at least they got something right....shame cuz other locations i have eaten at weren't bad,2.0

it is mediocre at best.,2.0
food took too long to arrive and we were rushed out of the restaurant.,2.0

the food was very lacking in flavor.,2.0
the carrots are overcooked.,2.0
"although the wait was minimal, unimpressed with the care.",2.0
the prices seem to have steadily climbed as well.,2.0
this spa is very small compared to other local resorts.,2.0
burgers were cooked very well done to the point of dry.,2.0
i think you are paying for ambiance and not the food.,2.0
it's on the pricey side so i say your better off spending your money elsewhere.,2.0
where to start..... food just isn't very good.,2.0
not impressed with the sins of sin city!,2.0
so...just wanted to give you the heads up when you consider ordering small or original.,2.0
most build your pizzas were wrong.,2.0
bbq in the south should be better than this.,2.0
"in all cases, the wait to order at the counter was very long.",2.0
i guess i need to head to nyc cause this experience was not the best.,2.0
should have just done that to start with.,2.0
but we laughed at the minuscule portions of ceviche and were never given bread.,2.0
"the tortillas are not that good, no carne asada or black beans.",2.0
it seems that many of their packaged items are overstocks and possibly seconds.,2.0
"got takeout, wings were ok but the nacho burger was pretty bad.",2.0
the prices are on the high side especially for a limited menu.,2.0
there are far better restaurants in toronto with friendlier service.,2.0
overall we were pretty disappointed.,2.0
prices are high for what you get .,2.0
very underwhelming way to kick things off.,2.0
"since the service sucked, i was not tempted to order the food.",2.0
the epitome of pretentious hipster coffee.,2.0
the bread part wasn't flaky and was kind of waxy to be honest.,2.0
it was mediocre at best.,2.0
they were cold and soupy.,2.0
"ordered margarita which sucked, not enough cheese.",2.0
a little too much flour if you ask me.,2.0
the food is quite poor in terms of taste and presentation.,2.0

overall disappointing for the price.,2.0

"both dishes were very dry, with little sauce.",2.0
was very disappointed in the quality of the food.,2.0
"however, the service was really slow, which i understand since it's a relatively new restaurant.",2.0
all of these flavors are missing from the food at vietnamese grille.,2.0
"upscale, modern ambience, good service, disappointing food.",2.0
nice staff.... down hill from there.,2.0
"i order the same thing every time, nothing special or custom just standard menu items.",2.0
"luckily though, airport are flush with bars to relieve a little travel stress.",2.0
it was supposed to be internally threaded.,2.0
my long island iced tea tasted like a virgin iced tea.,2.0
the quality just wasn't at the level that i would expect from the prices.,2.0
the food was on the slightly bland side.,2.0
not worth a special trip.,2.0
meal went down hill from there.,2.0
"she rushed painting the polish, as well as making a mess around my fingers.",2.0
the bread is cut messed up every time.,2.0
the sauce was much too salty and the peas did.,2.0
nothing about the food is woth mention.,2.0

"no supplies for felting , just the wool and not a great selection either.",2.0
"this place used to be much better, or maybe i had lower standards.",2.0

"on the other hand,their food was not great.",2.0
the food was bland.,2.0
the employees weren't very helpful either.,2.0
the zucchini fries were heavily breaded and kind of soggy.,2.0

"overall ny experiment of antonio's pizza was ""i'm never ordering this pizza again"".",2.0
"minimal flavor, and the portion sizes are very small.",2.0
they're priced for the torontonian's and not the locals that support all year long.,2.0
and the kitchen got the order wrong.,2.0
food were cold when served and the waitresses were totally attentive.,2.0
at this point not a big deal.,2.0
they are at best average.,2.0

two stars because the service was good.,2.0
i would either do lunch at a more reasonable price or take out.,2.0
"the portions are small, the chicken is chewy.. like u have to spit it out..ughh.",2.0
the only issue is price versus portion size.,2.0
the quality of the burger is not that great.,2.0

you are not allowed to taste anything here.,2.0
creamed spinach was no good.,2.0
not high on our list to return too.,2.0

those bussing the dishes made noise and breakage into an art form.,2.0
i wouldn't go out of my way to visit sushi bbq inn.,2.0
it is certainly going downhill.,2.0

"come to think of it, we didn't.",2.0
i am not a fan of sweet refried beans.,2.0
chips weren't very good.,2.0

nothing is really spicy.,2.0
i wasn't impressed with the menu at all.,2.0
water was not lukewarm but cold.,2.0

factor in the price and this place is a definite pass.,2.0
"not worth it, won't be back.",2.0
"however, when it comes to the wings, it's not always consistent.",2.0
employees should be a little more private about eating in front of customers.,2.0
i tried my friend's lamb rack and it was boring and flavorless.,2.0

"on top of that, they were way undercooked.",2.0
remind me not to go back to this place to get my brows waxed.,2.0

"the food is okay, but not great.",2.0
"he tried, but got the wine order wrong.",2.0
the food on the other hand was not so good.,2.0
biggest complaint is that they skimp on toppings.,2.0
prices are nearly double what they should be.,2.0
todo muy estúpidamente afrancesado.,2.0
what happened here merely made the experience even less appealing.,2.0

tiny little pieces of zucchini  heavlily breaded .,2.0
fish sandwiches are huge but not very good unless you like your breading falling off.,2.0
don't order the baked goat cheese unless you like a lot of tomato sauce.,2.0
attend only when necessary.,2.0
the cost didn't throw as the taste of it.,2.0
cheap but the food wasn't good.,2.0
food was relatively bland.,2.0
cloudy would have been an improvement.,2.0
my nails were kind of crooked and i got absolutely no hand massage.,2.0
presumably that was intentional as i have experienced this more than once.,2.0
i needed to remind myself what a real burrito tasted like.,2.0
"however, we didn't get basic things refreshed and had to call again.",2.0
definitely have had better tasting food for cheaper prices elsewhere.,2.0
there are way better breakfast places to eat at.,2.0
"to be honest, i'm not even sure the bourbon chicken was actually chicken.",2.0
ridiculous for a mini bare side salad and a drink that is carbonated water.,2.0

not sure if i'll try again.,2.0

the noodle bus offers neither.,2.0
there is no consistency with the food proportions and the way it's cooked.,2.0
it didn't seem worth the money.,2.0
the hotel did not grant me wifi or even water because of that waive.,2.0
the sauce was weird and definitely not traditional hot wing sauce.,2.0
the decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired.,2.0

"first, this place was a mess.",2.0
service here is ungodly slow!,2.0
the tots are bland and the coleslaw is no treat.,2.0
the cashier seemed new but at least she was friendly.,2.0
prices are high for pizza.,2.0
"from the sloppy ""uniforms"" to the holier than thou attitudes.",2.0
not good for me.,2.0
paid way too much for the quality of the wash.,2.0
i would rather get a sandwich for a gas station.,2.0
"however, the service is pretty terrible.",2.0
below average for board game cafés.,2.0
it was as if i were eating plain pasta.,2.0
the big guy that worked there wasn't very friendly.,2.0
"i was expecting some high quality bbq, but sadly i was a little let down.",2.0
we came here on holiday and were seriously overpriced.,2.0
will likely not return.,2.0
my kitchen and living room is not very big at all.,2.0
generally i have received comments from others that the staff is rather cold.,2.0
very disappointing because there is great potential here.,2.0
"no beverage upon check in, no bottled waters, no room upgrade...no free wifi!",2.0
not a good first experience here....,2.0
also not a great alcohol selection.,2.0
i have to fight for just a standard amount of toppings.,2.0
"plus when you walk into the lobby, it smells like chlorine.",2.0
i have had better fried chicken at fast food places for a lot less.,2.0
just a boring same ol' place.,2.0
!the staff is ok i guess it's just lack of staff training!,2.0
"we ordered two seafood entrees, two beers, and an order of sushi.",2.0
but the service was really just bearable.,2.0
other than that i have nothing good to say about it.,2.0
the side bar conversations instead of assisting customers some inappropriate ones at that.,2.0
do not order the carne asada tacos.,2.0
wont be coming back anytime soon.,2.0
and the amount of onions on it was enough for two.,2.0
the main problem is the workers.,2.0
it mostly came across as just meh.,2.0
"i've been to this location several times, but our latest experience was very poor.",2.0
"i tried the fresh watermelon juice, yuck.",2.0
the atmosphere is older and needs some updating.,2.0
rooms are worn out.,2.0
took an hour and a half and was seriously cooling down when it arrived.,2.0
"third, the beer was pretty tasty, but served lukewarm!",2.0
not very seasonal and not suiting the fish dish ordered.,2.0
our server was great and extremely overworked.,2.0
"got mine done and my car wasn't riding right, lots of vibrations and thumps.",2.0
i hate to admit that everything here were overrated.,2.0
don't expect much when coming here..,2.0
perhaps they should implement some sort of online check in.,2.0
"there are no frills, there are no items i would particularly recommend.",2.0
what made the experience not so great was the service.,2.0
even the cocktail sauce for the cold shrimp was bland.,2.0
this time may very well be the last.,2.0
kindly asked for it to cook a little longer and it came back burnt.,2.0
i find this very offputting.,2.0
just kind of disapointed as i was truly looking forward to some food.,2.0
"so, i waited, and waited.... you get the picture.",2.0
this has happened to me more than once.,2.0
if the place had been full...we would have been squeezed together...tables way too crowded.,2.0
saw numerous signs for towing but no spots for moe's.,2.0
i only give it two stars because of the cool building.,2.0
let me also warn you that the portion size is insufficient!,2.0

the salad could have been good had the ratio of ingredients been more balanced.,2.0
dry more than juicy.,2.0
the food ranged from merely fine to poor.,2.0
the service seemed amateurish.,2.0
i probably won't eat here again.,2.0
there are many better places to go in the area.,2.0
don't order the butter chicken if you love butter chicken.,2.0
nothing amazing or out of the ordinary.,2.0
the ice cream looked great but i didn't try it.,2.0
the rooms drastically need an overhaul and are very small.,2.0
the portions are not consistent and nobody seems to know what the other is doing.,2.0
"stop in for a pint after work, but don't make a dinner out of it.",2.0
food isn't that good.,2.0
at that point i was turned off by the whole experience.,2.0
it's not the lack of cleanliness of the restaurant.,2.0
what bothers me is the service.,2.0
they lacked any real flavor.,2.0
i'd recommend somewhere else first.,2.0
the space was so tight that our waitress stood behind me to take my order.,2.0
the brownie was dry and hard as a rock the next day.,2.0
the food was just not very good!,2.0

very very expensive for chinese dinner.,2.0
your better off walking across the street to applebee's.,2.0
this hotel was one of the worse embassy suites i've stand in.,2.0
what was really odd was the bbq sauce.,2.0
then mussels which were very fishy.,2.0
this created a lot of stress for our group.,2.0
bland and unseasoned to say the least.,2.0
the only reason i knew this is because the cheese was still slices and cold.,2.0
it was only double the price.,2.0
at that time when we were eating in there were no vegetarian options.,2.0
it was an disappointment as bun bo hue didn't come out hot.,2.0
"when we got our food, my grilled cheese was burnt on one side.",2.0
no value for money.,2.0

"the food wasn't particularly good, i ordered the chicken and macaroni with green beans.",2.0
"or, they've given you your order but forgot the salad or the side.",2.0
food was pretty good but the service was terrible.,2.0
the greens for the salad and burger also did not look fresh.,2.0
don't think it's worth the price.,2.0
the bread tray was almost empty.not impressed with it at all.,2.0
chicken tenders had no meat on them just breading.,2.0
it was more 'meh...' we bought tickets to mystere for the following night.,2.0
pasta needs salt and the steak was also lacking seasoning.,2.0
"regular burger ordered medium, came at least medium well.",2.0

but the service is always atrocious.,2.0
"unlikely that i will be back, too many better options around.",2.0
their prices are really high!,2.0
i'm giving this place two stars because of the bad customer service.,2.0
no fans or air conditioning in bathrooms.,2.0
the salmon was slimy and had no smoked flavor.,2.0
busy...but food was full of'food color' .prices was like other places.,2.0
only reason this place gets two stars is because of the food quality.,2.0
"but, the service and food was a disappointment.",2.0
and no olives in the martini.,2.0
good sound but otherwise not a fan.,2.0
i definitely got the impression that small customers dont mean that much to them.,2.0
service wasn't that great.,2.0
i should have sent it back honestly.,2.0
i went to burger king and just wanted nachos n cheese.,2.0
i most likely won't return unfortunately.,2.0
i'm giving two stars only because the workers seem relatively pleasant.,2.0
service wasn't the best.,2.0
i sort of felt like the table was infringing on my personal space.,2.0
not sure what the hype is about this place.,2.0
the reps are friendly but way overwhelmed.,2.0

i ordered two gyros and a large soda.,2.0

we went there based on the good reviews but probably won't go there again.,2.0

the food is just really bland.,2.0
it was cold by the time she got around to giving it to me.,2.0
the food was mediocre at best.,2.0
i actually don't see what the big hype is.,2.0
the wrapper was also a bit hard as well.,2.0
"all the dishes were bland, dry, and just not satisfying at all.",2.0
i still believe they lack communication with their guests and future guests.,2.0
the mashed potatoes are nothing special.,2.0
"the service is bad, the food is okay, avoid if you can,",2.0
and not very popular.,2.0
probably the most bland pho i've had in the valley.,2.0

"the customer service was great, hence the two stars.",2.0
our group was unfamiliar with the cuisine and our waiter was very little help.,2.0
i'll give it one more time and that's it.,2.0

our server might have been busy or distracted.,2.0
there are better options in neighboring scottsdale or even in tempe.,2.0

i think i'll stick with my other breakfast places and won't be back.,2.0
"if you think that's a good deal, you're insane in the membrane.",2.0
it all tasted like typical buffet food.,2.0

hope your experience is much more satisfying.,2.0
the clip arts were outdated and the binder was dirty.,2.0
the booth that we sat in had its upholstery all torn up.,2.0
"however, this fat wasn't that way.",2.0
literally a caprices sandwich served hot.,2.0
her job is not really that hard.,2.0
it took awhile to be seated and when we finally were we asked for water.,2.0

if your looking for a normal sized burrito this is not the place..,2.0
"so all in all, it was a pretty disappointing experience.",2.0
"fiancée got laksa and it was mediocre, at best.",2.0
i wouldn't pay their normal price though.,2.0
overall... food was rather overpriced.,2.0
you can definitely do better.,2.0
"omg, i only tasted whip cream mixed with crushed biscuit.",2.0
"the hollandaise was broken and curdled, and way too spicey.",2.0
i really wanted this sandwich to blow me away and it just didn't.,2.0
that's not the greatest security they got going on.,2.0
two stars for the view and ambience.,2.0
"oysters were the smallest i've ever seen, literally.",2.0
got chips for the wait but it still wasn't a pleasant experience.,2.0
their coffee is consistently good but their customer service is consistently awful.,2.0

"sorry, i mean milk.",2.0
but i would't go again.,2.0

honestly i was in there for parsley which isnt open yet.,2.0
"if the hot link is not good, i don't go back.",2.0
it sounds like we should have gone for breakfast instead!,2.0
my lunch was institutional and canned tasting.,2.0
the beef was very tough and not very appetizing.,2.0
we also asked what the rotolinis were and he gave us the wrong description.,2.0
my husband and i used to go to the location on bell rd.,2.0
except for whatever odd herbs were tossed atop it to give it a funky aftertaste.,2.0
i was irritated by the customer service.,2.0
but the guys don't look like the type who would get their hands dirty.,2.0
chicken on a pita is ok actually but the rest no so much.,2.0
the stock is irregular.,2.0
the sauce was so thick i felt like i was eating straight peanut butter.,2.0
hotel staff not as friendly as the other stays.,2.0
had to send it back since meat and sauce was served separately.,2.0
"so far, ok not great.",2.0
sad such a beautiful view is wasted on mediocre restaurant.,2.0
i'm not a big fan of the cosmo.,2.0
the problem is lack of consistency.,2.0
but i guess it's easier to just not do that.,2.0
i don't think i will be going back.,2.0
i'm going to think twice before i go to this store again.,2.0
my wife and i usually love this place but i was really disappointed today.,2.0
service was quite poor.,2.0
i feel like i only got an exterior wash.,2.0
hopefully since this is a rather new restaurant they will only get better from here.,2.0
team was lacking in thoroughness and professionalism.,2.0
the food...mediocre would be kind.,2.0
the wax service was brief and more painful than i had experienced at other places.,2.0

the decision to write the review was based more on the food service.,2.0
when my salad came out it was very dry!,2.0
waitress did take it off his bill.,2.0
"sadly, the bread was one of the better offerings.",2.0
the rolls have become small and the taste is different.,2.0
the servers are aloof.,2.0
it took over an hour and when our food finally came it was very disappointing.,2.0
"after a couple of weeks though, they stopped restocking it.",2.0
we stayed in this hotel last october and was not impressed.,2.0
menu was very limited and expensive.,2.0
"overcooked and brittle,served luke warm and very little cheese.",2.0
order bottle wine only to pour all glasses after the fist ourselves.,2.0
when we went to measure the photo it clearly wasn't a proper photo.,2.0
the staff was the only part of the evening that was good.,2.0
we ate outside because the inside stunk.,2.0
not a very good place to eat in my opinion.,2.0
food quality has clearly declined.,2.0
"but, it makes for some seriously awkward dipping with just chips.",2.0
tortilla soup was bland and only had one small bite of chicken in it.,2.0
the only redeeming thing was the salad which had some nice house made pickled veg.,2.0
"bummer, such a great atmosphere and menu is good but the service is terrible.",2.0
i don't think i would come here again.,2.0
also there was no airflow or air conditioning on a warm august evening.,2.0
in the last two months the dough or preparation quality has dropped considerably.,2.0
this would not be losing much space at all.,2.0
location is minuscule though so good luck sitting comfortably.,2.0
the bagel breakfast sandwich was also so hard it was difficult to bite into.,2.0
seemed like a nice place...just don't go for brunch.,2.0
the dumplings were really good but we were both very disappointed in our mains.,2.0
i've had better desserts in vegas for less than what that watery monstrosity cost.,2.0
i also didn't like how there was no place to sit and drink it.,2.0
finally the cantonese chowmein was oily and not particularly tasty.,2.0
it definitely isn't worth an up charge.,2.0
"my fried rice had dried shrimp in it, which has an extremely strong seafood smell.",2.0
it's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable.,2.0
overrated is probably the best way to rate this place.,2.0
probably won't go back.,2.0
nothing else to go with the tacos either.,2.0
the service was still great but the food was such a disappointment.,2.0
i would've gotten waffles but the waffle maker was broken...,2.0
one major problem is the service.,2.0

i've had better thai food at so many places.,2.0

the food lacked flavor.,2.0
"while the view of pittsburgh is stunning and the service excellent, the food was not.",2.0
"and apparently, my salad had been sitting for who knows how long in the back.",2.0
"also, no fried rice option.",2.0
they need a different chef and maybe even supplier.,2.0
the flights they offered were boring and over priced.,2.0
we waited hungrily before the soup arrived five minutes before the duck.,2.0
right now there's no reason for me to visit...except for matthew.,2.0
effort and attitude do not require any specific talent.....,2.0
i didn't get my asiago crust and thats the best part!!,2.0
really too expensive for a fast food !!,2.0
the facility itself is dingy and dark.,2.0
it was very underwhelming.,2.0
our server was just short of being downright rude when she finally did come by.,2.0
uncomfortable feeling to say the least.,2.0
"chicken was dry, green beans under seasoned and bland.",2.0
not at all worth a second visit.,2.0
the eggplant and garlic was way too sweet and had way too much sauce.,2.0
food took forever and when we received the food we  were  really disappointed.,2.0
maybe i just went to late but i was not impressed.,2.0
we were ... disappointed.,2.0
don't get the hummus appetizer.,2.0
they comped my drink to make me feel better but the experience just wasn't good.,2.0
"he looked at his clipboard, and us then kinda shrugged and asked what we wanted.",2.0
which was cause a lot of vibration whine driving higher speeds.,2.0
two stars because the waiter helped himself to my change when i paid.,2.0
likely to never return since there are more options in sin city.,2.0
there are many items that cost way more then they are supposed to.,2.0
the meal was just that freakin' bad.,2.0
maybe they could use different products.,2.0
"it wasn't horrible, but i won't be back.",2.0
but the service kinda sucks.,2.0
"too bad, considering the nice fireplace that is close to this area.",2.0
"generally speaking, plate presentation was poor.",2.0

the waffle was very greasy.,2.0
not enough restaurants and some lots are empty.,2.0

way too expensive for the amount or quality,2.0
i doubt we will be back.,2.0
"the staff is very friendly, however the food isn't the greatest.",2.0
the saag paneer was cold as well as a couple of the other dishes.,2.0
management needs to retrain staff i think.,2.0
i've eaten much better and at a much lower price.,2.0
i just think they could do a lot better.,2.0
for the prices they charge i expected a lot more.,2.0
don't serve me some hot water and call it cold brew.,2.0
slow and unorganized service.,2.0
"nicely decorated, however, the service i received was poor.",2.0
overall a very blah place.,2.0
"our waitress, however, left much to be desired.",2.0
"this was a mom and pop shop, not a professional salon.",2.0
you wouldn't think it served fast food just by walking in.,2.0
the past two times we went we haven't been happy.,2.0
"ok food and prices, extremely slow service.",2.0
"tonight though, not a good experience and service was the issue.",2.0
the train ride...thats crap.,2.0
the rice got over cooked and tacos were luke warm.,2.0
"and no, not really in a good way.",2.0
"there was hardly any flavor in the pork, and the egg rolls...too bad.",2.0
"my second time back, not so good.",2.0
the food was meh  basically a typical resort buffet with a couple extra perks.,2.0
fries were limp on the soggy side.,2.0
hipster sushi... no thanks.,2.0
they really didn't have any rolls that were warm or not doused in a sauce.,2.0
not quite a substitute for wings.,2.0
i had to get my computer over by the door or it wouldn't connect.,2.0
"when the food came, it was hot but lacking a lot of flavor.",2.0
the lower rating is because our service this night was really poor.,2.0

there was also very few choices for the vegetarian guests.,2.0
"just overall no good, service was just whatever.",2.0
i've given this place a few tries.,2.0
we felt that the food should have been more than mediocre for the price.,2.0
nothing to do with the food but everything to do with customer service.,2.0
not worth the hassle.,2.0
i was annoyed enough by the service that i no longer go here.,2.0
"however, we were disappointed when the burgers arrived.",2.0
the bar was under served with too few bar tenders.,2.0
now they just need to learn how to make decent food.,2.0
"no veggi options, no choice of bread, just what was there, much like a starbucks.",2.0
wasn't the best by far.,2.0
i don't really have much to say other than being disappointed with this experience.,2.0

way too many places in sw calgary super disappointed.,2.0
"fourth, the room was not clean.",2.0
the casino facilities are super depressing and sad.,2.0
the butter chicken was watery and more like soup.,2.0

"the selection is decent, but nothing is that good.",2.0
the service was alright but the food was terrible.,2.0
salads included cucumber salad and lettuce.,2.0
but the walls are paper thin and so are the ceilings.,2.0
our waitress also never checked on us once after our meals were served.,2.0
i get that your trying to be hipster wearing your black glasses and mom jeans.,2.0
there was barely a handful of noodles in the bowl.,2.0
the atmosphere is sorta cold.,2.0
wait staff needs to pay attention to their customers and less watching the games.,2.0
i tried the beef meatballs and i don't like them at all.,2.0
and not once were our water glasses refilled.,2.0
didn't give me the topping i ordered.,2.0
the only saving grace was the champaign... and they were stingy with that.,2.0
"the meat was dry, the tomatoes were soggy, and the french fries were hard!",2.0
if it weren't for the great services i would have given themone star.,2.0
we didn't send it back since the one portion was enough for us.,2.0

the whole store could use better management.,2.0

it's really small... only three tables.,2.0
overall the cheese was the only good part.,2.0
i couldn't taste the burger part due to the overwhelming use of sauce.,2.0
"sorry, two stars for tonight's dinner service.",2.0
i'm not sure what happened...the service still sucks!,2.0
he yanked on my arms instead of giving directions and generally made the experience uncomfortable.,2.0
we thought we would give it another go last night but were disappointed.,2.0
they didn't taste better either.,2.0
food tends to sit for too long leaving dishes both luke warm and soggy.,2.0
the barley soup that comes with the kebob is tasteless.,2.0
"good idea for a date night, but not executed well.",2.0
"i don't mean warm, i mean cold.",2.0
food quality has been uneven over the years.,2.0
quality of the food isn't that great.,2.0
the bacon looked like what you get at a hotel free buffet breakfast.,2.0

it seems that the food quality declines every time i go.,2.0

but it's not all that good.,2.0

beautiful presentation but did not taste as good as it looked.,2.0
"the pickles tasted like every other restaurant, they probably all receive the same product.",2.0
"my friend had the fried chicken, which he thought was slightly undercooked and tasteless.",2.0
it's like they used the same seasoning for a lot of their hot menu items.,2.0
and the brussel sprout was undercooked.,2.0
maybe it was a fluke and i received a small.,2.0
just didn't seem like the place was run well.,2.0
the food is overpriced.,2.0
i would recommend mod pizza for better pies at a fraction the cost.,2.0
sandwiches were just ok and nothing memorable at all.,2.0
it was splotchy after two days.,2.0
"all in all, i wasn't impressed and i highly doubt be returning.",2.0

"portions looked large, but it just did not look appetizing to me.",2.0
and god forbid if you order chips and salsa.,2.0
"custom rolls were weak, freshness was questionable and the price was way to high.",2.0
old casino and rooms....i would not stay here again.,2.0
everything was below the standard of what you would expect a bellagio buffet should be.,2.0
otherwise it is a pretty dumpy place.,2.0
look at the refried beans.,2.0
prices are high and customer service not good.,2.0
most of the walls of covered in teenage scrawling similar to rebel pizza.,2.0
too pricey for south phoenix.,2.0
plus the floor was filthy.,2.0

"the food is mediocre at best, and the customer service is poor.",2.0
unlike cafe rio they severely skimp on the ingredients.,2.0

it was so spicy i can't really say if it was good or not.,2.0
nothing i would go back for.,2.0

hardly any choices on the menu and not sure if anyone really enjoyed their meal.,2.0
this place is all about big mediocre portions.,2.0
sakura is so much better.,2.0

"yes, nicholas coffee is really the only reason i ever come down this way.",2.0
the seafood dishes the last two times were not as fresh as should be.,2.0

the coffee was the bigger disappointment.,2.0
dine at liberty just the other day and basically confused by the experience.,2.0

a little too much batter than what i'm used to and not too flavorful.,2.0
wish there were other local options in the area.,2.0
the coffee was acidic and watery...like a low quality breakfast joint.,2.0
over hyped and overrated.,2.0
i will be going elsewhere!!!,2.0
i was in the other day and the walls and shelves were very bare.,2.0
chicken with carrots and potatoes mash.,2.0

the food is average at best.,2.0
"the ham and cheese omelet was ok, but bland.",2.0
i've had better sushi for the same price.,2.0
"lobster bisque was ordered for starter, nice consistency but pretty bland in flavor.",2.0
maybe the smelly carpet and dive bar like atmosphere dampened my review.,2.0
doch das essen war leider überhaupt nicht angemessen.,2.0
decor bordered on psychedelic.,2.0
"both were nice, but bland.",2.0
most recently my pedicure was rushed and completed very sloppily.,2.0
they were quick and they are nice people but their prices suck.,2.0

the food is not good and they are understaffed.,2.0

the waiter was nice enough but seemed scatter brained.,2.0
it was a tad sour and in some spots cold.,2.0
"not only that, they get pissy when you use a credit card.",2.0
we will go elsewhere.,2.0
i was quite disappointed with their pho.,2.0
that stuff must have been sitting in the back of the freezer for ages.,2.0
"sad to say, the food tasted like the decor of this casino downtown...old.",2.0
"however the english muffin was thin, chewy and burnt.",2.0
"the only thing making it edible was the shredded beef, at least that was moist.",2.0
not that i have much of anything else to add.,2.0
i just wish they would have done a better job.,2.0
nothing mind blowing or to rave about.,2.0
this place lacks variety.,2.0
"we were also waited on quickly, however i had to ask for water three times.",2.0
so all of the other food was cold.,2.0

food was not memorable.,2.0
not the best buffet ever.,2.0

"the only good meal was the banana foster french toast, which we ended up sharing.",2.0
the brisket was overly salty and dry.,2.0
it's hard to mess up eggs and bacon.,2.0
a shame considering the presentation was great and the ingredients looked colourful and fresh!,2.0
so make sure to be specific and redundant in the order details until its fixed.,2.0
our waitress was just not the best.,2.0
when you're searching through your soup for edible beef you might as well search elsewhere.,2.0
i must be going crazy but every dish tastes the same to me here.,2.0
if it wasn't for the really awesome salsa then i'd say it totally sucked.,2.0
the service was meh.,2.0

stayed for the shake...the only thing that's great about this place.,2.0
"just the same tired over cooked food, with too much white flour and sugar.",2.0
food after some point was meh...,2.0
every time i thought about saying something she'd soften up.,2.0
for the prices i expected more.,2.0
the service was nice but that did not make the food any less gross.,2.0
"but other than that, don't come here to waste your precious time.",2.0
won't try it a third time.,2.0
i think maybe they make it with sour cream instead of mayo.,2.0
my wife and i ordered and the above mentioned man brought us the wrong dishes.,2.0
no offer for help or to see if i have questions.,2.0
i believe this needs more than just chips and one egg.,2.0
the table was sticky and one of place settings was in a glass.,2.0
other tables around are left uncleaned.,2.0
my husband ordered their famous onion soup which was salty and sour.,2.0

the papardele was mediocre.,2.0
"let alone a glass of tea, which both happened.",2.0
i am not sure if it was a replacement act or one of the regulars.,2.0
and on the down side it is pretty pricey for a bland hamburger.,2.0
"they did offer to fix me something else, but i didn't want anything else.",2.0
i don't think that i've seen the same delivery driver twice.,2.0
the sauces are fake and the food is greasy and slicked up with oils.,2.0
"neither of our trips were during a prime hours, holidays or special events.",2.0
the food quality has also gone downhill and the portions are small and  inconsistent.,2.0
the brunch was way too fried and left a bad aftertaste.,2.0
have had better pricey,2.0
i am not really sure why this place gets such high reviews for the food.,2.0

took an hour and half till drinks were served.,2.0
the delivery service is kind of terrible.,2.0
"service was very ""meh"".",2.0
"not a big deal, i would just wait a bit longer to get mine.",2.0

your money can be put to better use elsewhere...,2.0

to be located inside the aria the service  was below expectations.,2.0
but the food is more salty than last time.,2.0
"the risotto was so dry, we asked for more drinks.",2.0
i am not a fan of the liberty.,2.0
way too overpriced for what you get.,2.0
"but, the thing that really put me off of this place was the service.",2.0
"maybe it's just a stuffy scottsdale thing, but i wasn't really into it.",2.0
but for hair cut it was definitely a waste of money.,2.0
no history of how the instrument fits in with a culture.,2.0
probably won't be going back.,2.0
will give it another try with the band .,3.0
expensive but good beer selection.,3.0
the korean food here tastes different from korean food elsewhere.,3.0

the home fries were a different story.,3.0
"it's quite convininet as it is in same mall as milestones, ichiban, loblaws, dollarama etc.",3.0
"all in all, the dessert comment sums it up.",3.0
local place for locals.,3.0
prices are on the upper end of the scale but they don't skimp on portions.,3.0
though it would have been better paired with a heavier dish.,3.0
a solid thai restaurant.,3.0
wish they had another accessible bathroom downstairs.,3.0
"food is ok not a ""real traditional "" mexican food restaurant.",3.0
it is pretty banal in its appearance both inside and outside.,3.0
the rooms generally are nice and spacious.,3.0
i recommend the tnt if you want a lot of spice.,3.0

i dropped into czehoski for some drinks with some friends.,3.0
it was temperature hot and tasty.,3.0
