and there are definitely much better fulci's.,2.0
sorry... that was a bit too much artistic license for my tastes.,2.0
this was obviously put together in a hurry with little effort.,2.0
a low budget predictable yarn.,2.0

the book was wayyyyy better.,2.0
i thought the perspective was overly friendly to the subject.,2.0

the male lead character was new to me and didn't impress me.,2.0
it made the whole experience more and more unenjoyable.,2.0
drawn out and long.,2.0
didn't finish the episode because of it.,2.0
"this was not fleshed out and acting was only so, so.",2.0
i was quite disappointed after renting this movie.,2.0
such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability.,2.0
a clear case trying too hard and appealing to a very narow audience.,2.0

this remake falls way short.,2.0

"this technicolour wide screen murder mystery is an overproduced, overdressed, artificial talk fest.",2.0
just wasn't for me,2.0
sadly though this last season was very disappointing for me.,2.0
too predictable... paul walker was the reason we watched it.,2.0
only worth watching if you have nothing else to do.,2.0
the wait was too long and the result disatrous.,2.0
but there is little or no feeling of connection in the movie.,2.0
and that's about it.,2.0
all the good stuff was edited out!,2.0
did not care for movie.,2.0
a genuine let down.,2.0
it just dragged on and on wasn't for me,2.0
the fact is youll have difficulty in getting linked to this movie.,2.0

the kid who plays a teenager in the movie is unrealistic.,2.0
"it came across as rather old hat, however, and mostly boring.",2.0
"however, the ending was awful and ruined what might have been a pretty good flick.",2.0
i'd rather watch role models!,2.0
there have to be better movies about costumes and fashion in film.,2.0
"also  he wasn't very funny at all, taxi was the only thing he done well.",2.0
he is simply miscast in this role.,2.0
the film is over loaded with special effects and not much else.,2.0

even the poor king's costume lacks regality.,2.0
"thirdly, all other aspects of this picture are disappointing.",2.0
just not funny enough for me.,2.0
close but no cigar.,2.0
maybe just not cuppa.,2.0
it really isn't that good of a movie.,2.0
this had such potential and it was such a very clever idea.,2.0
robin williams has many better movies than this one.,2.0
i fell asleep before it was over.,2.0

the movie leaves you with nothing but unanswered questions.,2.0
my wife seemed to like this but not too much.,2.0
"we've all seen this story done before, and we've all seen it done much better.",2.0
the only good thing about the film is the acting.,2.0
but it doesnt really.,2.0
the only performance that stands out is stanley tucci's as the creepy murderer.,2.0
so my advice is skip the movie.,2.0
twister was way better.,2.0
i would hold off unless you really like the film.,2.0
it just was soooo not for me... but like i said.,2.0
i'm sorry the original cast did not continue into this season.,2.0

quite a silly movie with good actors.,2.0
a waste of michael shannon.,2.0

for those couple reasons i give this one two stars instead of one.,2.0
i flat out disagree.,2.0
"goofy movie, he has done better movies.",2.0
very old movie but the end of it was very vague.,2.0
the whole film is overwrought.,2.0
the characters are never fully developed.,2.0
but the plot is so tired at this point.,2.0
"so, the camera equipment was top notch, but narration and general setting was pathetic.",2.0
i doubt i will ever watch it again.,2.0
everything was just too easy.,2.0

i actually have not seen anything quite this infantile before.,2.0
"this is not an awful film, not by a long shot.",2.0
loved david tennant in dr who but this was dull.,2.0

i wanted to like this movie.,2.0
mediocre is the word for this film.,2.0
difficult to sit through.,2.0
"very slow, hard to hold my attention however freeman was his usual self.",2.0
"the story line seemed muddled, the acting uninspired and the outcome contrived.",2.0
the unrealistic dialogue and lack of character development didn't do the actors any favors.,2.0
i didn't care for this one.,2.0

either that or someone had some racy pictures of him.,2.0
paramount's current management is not of the caliber of previous management generations.,2.0

who was disappointed in this movie.,2.0
it was too much.,2.0
"this is a typical ""dirty cop"" movie, with nothing to recommend it.",2.0
wasn't in the mood for all the violence.,2.0
a long silly movie about absolutely nothing.,2.0
not sure i can recommend this.,2.0
first jason statham film i have not liked.,2.0
even having thor in the lead couldn't save this movie.,2.0
that's why i gave it two stars instead of one.,2.0

the acting was uninspired.,2.0
"the acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths.",2.0

execution can make that a good premise or a bad one.,2.0
"a whole lot of style, but precious little substance.",2.0
"i disagreed then, but find his critique sadly appropriate here.",2.0
this movie was very hard to accept.,2.0
"slow paced, predictable and not really that funny.",2.0
not much in the way of scarey fun.,2.0
and it is certainly not helped by the awful editing.,2.0
this just appears to be a technical problem.,2.0
it really irritated me to see this careless treatment of such a classic.,2.0
it didn't really work on any level.,2.0
i was thoroughly bored by the theme and pace of this movie.,2.0
"it has a few good parts, but not nearly enough to make a cohesive whole.",2.0
"instead, spend a few hours and read phillipa gregory's marvelous book by the same name.",2.0
i felt the monologue explanation should have been left out.,2.0
"sadly, it's written and directed like a hastily assembled after school special.",2.0
the story line was extremely weak and i believe it also lacked research.,2.0

"watch if you want... b movie, plus a tad weird.",2.0
it has some action but that is only  the shooting that are dumb.,2.0
not enough on the sforzas and everything was too easy for cesare.,2.0
that did little to give purpose or coherence to the film.,2.0
"unfortunately, i respectfully disagree with some of the other commentators.",2.0
there was just too much wrong with the movie.,2.0
the only bright spots were angie cepeda and james franco.,2.0
"dwayne johnson, love him, but this movie just didn't cut it.",2.0
the problem with this one is it is so slow and boring.,2.0
really didn't like it,2.0
the female research character is completely unnecessary.,2.0
entire movie is about jeremy renner trying to get pills.,2.0
didn't care for this movie,2.0
they never really even explained why elysium was so much better.,2.0
mediocre plot not worth spending much time watching unless you have nothing else to do.,2.0
this second installment woefully failed to live up to the first movie.,2.0
russian attempt at a modern production.,2.0
"not as great as advertised, the ending is totally absurd.",2.0
not good in my opinion.,2.0

"the writers tried to make it unexpected and interesting, but its not well done.",2.0
"if you like car and bike crashes than maybe it""s ok.",2.0
it was really downright silly.,2.0
not one of boris' best,2.0
perhaps it got better but it doesnt matter because it was boring.,2.0
maybe if you're in a frat or something about that age it would be ok.,2.0
"for those who want the typical horror mystery flick, this probably won't work.",2.0
didn't finish watching lost interest.,2.0
"in my opinion, the show was also very boring in spots, especially the underwater ballet.",2.0
"the plot seems awfully familiar...of tim burton's other animated film, the nightmare before christmas.",2.0
nice concept... poorly written screen play,2.0
the director is most to blame but the writing and pacing are also turgid.,2.0
"i watched is once, fell asleep, watched it again and realized why i fell asleep.",2.0

it could have been a great movie without it.,2.0
first one much better!,2.0
my fault for having higher expectations.,2.0
"it was very hard to follow, and the ending let one questin.",2.0
...and maybe that is understated.,2.0
at that time it had very little to recommend it.,2.0
the way this movie started it seemed to yanked me the wrong way.,2.0

great acting and directing and yet a very boring film still came out of it.,2.0

not my cup of tea.,2.0
i really wasn't thrilled with this.,2.0
"just a big, weird jumble.",2.0

but the rest is just awful and lame...,2.0
"too much of the same thing throughout, with too much narrative by the same people.",2.0
nothing connected me to the characters or plot.,2.0

these and many other questions are left unanswered in this made for tv dud.,2.0

the lighting in this movie was just kind of bland and dishwatery.,2.0
didn't make much sense.,2.0

a b movie if that.,2.0
confusing i didn't care for this movie.,2.0
the video quality is also poor and not what you would expect from a dvd.,2.0
the only good thing was seeing those two gorgeous cars.,2.0

this movie was too long and boring.,2.0
"i would have given it one star, but the visual effects were very well done.",2.0
it keeps speeding up like its trying to fast forward.,2.0
that part was tooo funny!!,2.0
that doesn't cover the full depth of crummy for this movie.,2.0
the actors are mostly silly to include the director.,2.0
they lost us with the painfully slow pace of the story.,2.0
these actors' talents are wasted on this ridiculous script.,2.0
the worst thing is the fighting scenes.,2.0
did not hold my interest.,2.0

the premise is already trite...falsely accused person.,2.0
tried to watch it twice now and fell asleep both times.,2.0
there is little action and many sequences drag.,2.0
"i like mel brooks, but this movie was too weird for me.",2.0
i'll probably never watch it again.,2.0
it's also really lacking in humor unlike the first one.,2.0
too much narration in this case was a sign of a poor scene adaptation.,2.0
but none of the elements come off on their own and cohere together.,2.0
the book is much better!!!,2.0
more disjointed than i remember.,2.0
i was hoping for some kind of catharsis or emotional pay off  which never came.,2.0

"i didn't care for it, slow and seemingly pointless.",2.0
the back story on the demon was muddled and boring.,2.0
too bad it was not very good.,2.0
i am left disappointed.,2.0
kind of like mr. popper's penguins...it was a disappointment when i actually watched it.,2.0
this was a below average movie in which i found no joy,2.0
and some things i just didn't understand why they even wrote it in there.,2.0
the first ghost rider was much better,2.0
way to long and i skipped the middle.,2.0
the murder she baked mysteries are so much better.,2.0
"this could have been a good move, instead it is a farce.",2.0
not my kind of flick,2.0
that's really about all there is to the plot of the movie.,2.0
but this sequel just didn't hold water.,2.0
"i'm sorry, because it sounded like an interesting movie, but it just made me dizzy.",2.0
"slow paced, repetitive, and i would have liked a more science.",2.0

there was a lot of slashing and blood flying etc.,2.0
"cheap jokes, cheap laughs and a lot of failed humor.",2.0
they should have stopped with second one... first one was amazing.,2.0
this movie doesn't do it for me.,2.0
bottom line is that the movie is two hours too long.,2.0
it's just not much more than that.,2.0
i found this movie disturbing so i didn't watch it the whole way.,2.0
as a story it is badly flawed.,2.0
the plot was completely unoriginal and predictable.,2.0

"it's so simplistic, it's almostboring.",2.0
normally i love any movies with salman khan but this one is a real disappointment.,2.0
a loud if the coolest effects weren't done with computers.,2.0

the premise was promising.,2.0
mcqueen was good but overall it just wasn't worth spending money  on.,2.0
i would say the best thing was the cinematography but most of it was cgi.,2.0

it would have been nice to have seen the ending.,3.0
"not a bad dvd for adults but a little deep, slow and complicated for children.",3.0
i'll be brief on this one.,3.0
i like blythe danner as an actor but her performance was stiff.,3.0
it was a fairly interesting story but it seemed to drag on.,3.0
its not the best horror movie on the market but it's still entertaining.,3.0
solid but not spectacular.,3.0
i was hoping for more of the spirit and feel of the original series.,3.0
it definitely had its moments.,3.0
there are two major flaws with the plot.,3.0

"this movie was just okay, nothing spectacular.",3.0
decent thriller about two high school guys and phone pranking gone wrong.,3.0
better then i expected.,3.0
"all in all, it is a fairly fun movie but it is completely disposable.",3.0
"george, we love you, but it is time to move on.",3.0
so many of them aren't nearly as creative as these.,3.0
each episode is entertaining to a point.,3.0
"it was interesting, and kept me interested enough to keep watching.",3.0
more of a problem with the script than the acting.,3.0
"having lived through the era, the context was slightly inauthentic.",3.0
i must say even his early acting performances were impressive.,3.0
it was like ocean's eleven but without the cool stuff.,3.0

but i have a problem with laugh tracks.,3.0
"quality ok not for the period, but not great...acceptable.",3.0
"a bit draggy, but held my interest sufficiently.",3.0
"nowadays, however, special effects don't  seem so spectacular.",3.0
not the best nicholas cage movie.,3.0
it was a good old fashion story.,3.0
watch is you like action and suspense but don't expect a great movie.,3.0
this story starts well.,3.0
it is better if you assume it is a comedic satire of demon movies.,3.0
just an ok movie.,3.0
this move was okay and had very good information there in.,3.0
i didn't like the ending.,3.0
the film has however also some serious scenario weaknesses which hurt it a lot.,3.0
"the music was average, but there were some entertaining dance scenes.",3.0
i enjoyed the first two much better.,3.0

i think i simply found it ... not as interesting as i would have liked.,3.0
mildly entertaining and historically accurate.,3.0
"if you can get this for a decent price, than worth the money.",3.0
it will do if your bored.,3.0
overall i enjoyed watching it but it's not high on my list of favorite movies.,3.0
it was not the best movie but not the worst .,3.0
other than that i like brian so i watched it.,3.0
worth a watch and there is some gore.,3.0
it could have moved along a little faster,3.0
not the best bruce willis movie i have seen but certainly not the worst.,3.0
these movies aren't that bad but at the same time it could be wayyyyyyyyyyyyy better,3.0

not as good as i would have expected,3.0
"not too bad, worth watching.",3.0
not as good as expected,3.0
"thus being flynn leaves us unsatisfied, with the drama not gritty enough to feel real.",3.0
dawn remake is better but not that much better.,3.0
nothing all that unique.,3.0
it wasn't a problem with the director or the actors or anything.,3.0
k. branagh loose and half way funny act is a distraction.,3.0
this film has a bit of an indiana jones feel in places.,3.0

ok show nothing great.,3.0
this movie had it's moments.,3.0
"it wasn't quite what i expected, but it was interesting nonetheless.",3.0

"i think it's not a great film, but it has some great moments.",3.0
it wasn't expensive at all and the movies kept my interest from beginning to end.,3.0
"wooden acting, but hey, it's a martial arts movie.",3.0
she actually has a secondary role with robert wagner playing the main character.,3.0
the story only covers the first year of robinson's baseball career.,3.0
worth a rental at best.,3.0
the book is better,3.0
the shipping news is ok for tv,3.0
i wouldn't watch again.,3.0
the after dark horror fest is a pretty inconsistent series.,3.0
a lot of action but not believablel!,3.0

it had some funny parts.,3.0
bit graphic but decent twists and storyline,3.0
"meh..good acting, but the story seems to rush to a conclusion.",3.0
"i thought the story dragged a bit, but i watched it all the way through.",3.0
it's pretty average in most respects but also kinda cool here and there.,3.0

pretty lame slasher flick but i like horror movies so i kind of liked it.,3.0
this was not bad.,3.0
"funny, but not genius.",3.0
one episode was really enough for me.,3.0
these are very heavy on buried treasures and hidden gems.,3.0

"not a bad story, but i would rather watch ""the shining"" for the umpteenth time.",3.0
"as for the much talked about lesbian scene, well, it has been better done elsewhere.",3.0
good story line but slow start.,3.0
this movie was ok.,3.0
it still has that simplistic quality that i love with these kind of films.,3.0
cute...with some eastern wisdom added,3.0
hard to follow the twists and turns.,3.0
for that and the good performance of remick i give it three stars.,3.0
mine might not be the best review to decide to buy or not.,3.0
that is the reason for the three star.,3.0
"the story is alright, it's not hard to follow, but it is decent.",3.0
"truthfully, the movie feels a tad slow with nonstop action sequence.",3.0
better or more thought put into their powers maybe.,3.0
the next day i decided to give the film a chance so i watched it.,3.0
it had its moments.,3.0
"it was okay, and only just.",3.0
the film is great fun... but it is a forgettable kind of fun.,3.0

i expected more from wes anderson.,3.0

predictable with a little excitment.,3.0
"the animation isn't great, and the stories are simple, but enjoyable.",3.0

the movie was good until it go to the end.,3.0

"had to give this one an ""okay"" rating.",3.0
not one of clint's best but a nice try.,3.0
was kind'a disappointed .,3.0
"the movie was well directed, but its more of a kids movie.",3.0
ok to watch once for the entertainment.,3.0
"somehow, though, these elements didn't gel into a completely satisfying movie experience for me.",3.0
good movie but acting was a little novice for my tastes,3.0
the stories are interesting if you want information more than entertainment.,3.0
the film differs considerably from both the novel and the play.,3.0
not as good as i expected,3.0
i won't be continuing myself though.,3.0
relationship of characters confusing at times.,3.0
jennifer connelly as the lesbian is almost ridiculously good for the role.,3.0
"not a bad movie, per se, just not a lot of depth to it.",3.0
"overall, not bad but nothing amazing either.",3.0
"and, for that matter, a little bit of a heavy one with a dark side.",3.0
nova does excellent work usually but this episode could have been better.,3.0

but still funny at times.,3.0
"overall the movie is, you guessed it...... decent.",3.0
"pretty predictable but it's easy to watch, i suppose especially for chicks.",3.0
i just wish the movie had been better.,3.0
the tragic backstory of the sheriff sort of petered out though.,3.0
her accent sounded a bit too forced.,3.0
"episodes get a bit redundant, could use some better writers and cast is just ok.",3.0
just don't expect to be amazed at the ending.,3.0
jodi foster's character for sure was slighted on development.,3.0
i would have liked to have had them more in line with the book.,3.0
"lot's of action, not alot of talking.",3.0
a good cast and some thrilling moments combine with some good visual shark effects.,3.0
interesting but flawed crime thriller.,3.0
this movie was more romance than scifi for those who are looking for scifi.,3.0
the movie is more for adults.,3.0
had to actually read before watching.,3.0
just an average movie if that..,3.0
"this volume seemed a bit forced, imho.",3.0
it was all okay but many we like much better.,3.0
slow most of the times...,3.0
surely it has not excited me for wanting more as season one did.,3.0
could have been edited a little better.,3.0
while somewhat entertaining it lacks the originality and characterazation of earlier offerings.,3.0
it's a good flick unless you know something about the tradecraft of the cia.,3.0
while the video and audio are great the extras are sadly lacking.,3.0
"a bit contrived at the end, but not a bad film.",3.0
so in that sense it offers something new.,3.0
"i thought it would be great, but it really could have been better.",3.0
she could have better explained what she was doing.,3.0
"the plot, however, looses steam after the opening.",3.0
"the shadow conspiracy is a predictable, at times implausible, and often shoddily photographed thriller.",3.0
julia roberts has seen better days and better characters.,3.0
"it was an entertaining couple hours, but it's just not up to bsg standards.",3.0
a fairly formulaic western.,3.0

i still like the story lines but very bizarre.,3.0
it's a mediocre romantic comedy.,3.0

"not great, not bad.",3.0
"a little ""rough"" around the edges.",3.0
"it was hard to follow at times,",3.0
it was ok for a one night stand.,3.0
i can only give the film three stars because it is too choppy.,3.0

"the story is good, but it lost the series' innocence.",3.0
"not the best of the after dark set, but not the worst.",3.0
"some fun kills, namely the rafting scene many talk about.",3.0

we had hoped this would follow the book better.,3.0
"on the bright side, however, the overall take on nabokov's story  is an interesting one.",3.0
"although i don't consider this movie a horror movie, it is at times a thriller.",3.0
"a goofy, often funny, movie that's almost entertaining the entire way through.",3.0
it was ok. not the best story,3.0
sad ending actually a slight twist on real life fate of one of the principals.,3.0
the movie was intriguing enough but it lacked a genuine sense of action.,3.0
i gave this dvd three stars instead of two because i love jonathan winters.,3.0
but the movie ultimately stalls out...making it the weakest of the series so far.,3.0

"if you have a casual interest in that process, it's okay.",3.0
so so anime...kind of funny for times,3.0

rent it first and judge for yourself.,3.0
"ok, let's be honest.",3.0
average entertainment just about what you expect with this budget level flix...,3.0
this silly and at times dumb movie is one to be just watched and enjoyed.,3.0

not as good as i remembered.,3.0
i just watched it last night and am having a hard time recalling the plot.,3.0
"worth a watch, but prepared to be a bit disappointment in the end.",3.0
good acting for that time period.,3.0
would have liked more depth of characters and history.,3.0
a good basic comedy movie.,3.0
ok. inappropriate for my grandson,3.0

"elsewhere, though, curtis's preference for quantity over quality gets a bit irritating.",3.0
"it is of course worth checking out, but not to buy.",3.0
a good summation though.,3.0

still unnerving in parts.,3.0
"good acting, good filmmaking, some weakness in the screenplay make it a bit slow.",3.0
"soesn't seem like much time was spent in the story, but on the screen.",3.0
you'll like it if you keep your expectations low.,3.0

i would like it much better without the language.,3.0

"acting is good, and special effects are usually not bad.",3.0
the first part of the movie seemed to follow the book pretty well.,3.0

lots of red in the dissolves.,3.0
"they were a little distracting, maybe that's what the director was aiming for.",3.0

"it's not a bad movie by any means, just average at best.",3.0
the show is okay.,3.0
it wasn't spectacular or as bad as some reviewers would have you believe.,3.0

the movie was okay.,3.0
i'm a little sorry about that too.,3.0
but it was neat and scary for it's time.,3.0
"all in all, the cast isn't too bad.",3.0
doesn't make a lot of sense at times.,3.0
"no great acting required, but her innocent screen presence added tons to the movie.",3.0
but it may have been a starting point for many of the actors.,3.0
it was ok nicolas cage's movies are hit and miss.,3.0

it's a average movie with top notch effects and a decent story.,3.0
"fitfully entertaining, but not cagney and hawks at their best.",3.0
"pretty ok, worth the money, not their best.",3.0
you give guest and cast a good run for the money.,3.0

confusing at times and takes a while to catch on.,3.0

started out refreshingly different but ended up somewhat predictable.,3.0
over all a fairly decent movie.,3.0
the dialogue was often low and muffled while the loud parts were booming.,3.0
"enjoyable, but not outstanding.",3.0
the dvd is in full frame and the sound is clear but not exceptional.,3.0
it does this in three places.,3.0
"worth seeing if you've read the book, otherwise the pbs doc is far superior.",3.0
i guess i just expected more .,3.0
the writing could have been more biting and the characters could have had more depth.,3.0
"not a lot of depth or production value, but an ok look at leatherman culture.",3.0
this was slightly different than i was expecting.,3.0
i'm reluctant to keep following what was a great series,3.0
i might watch it again sometime.,3.0

i get an occasional curiosity about what makes these people tick.,3.0
not bad but it doesn't live up to the hype.,3.0

not up to par with nine to five.,3.0
interesting to see a bromance cop movie when the genre was in startup.,3.0
the acting is mostly good though stewart's manic behaviour is rather annoying.,3.0
only the mammoths get three stars!!!,3.0
"i won't give it away but...not bad, decent watch",3.0
all the actors are great though.,3.0

i thought it was predictable but fun to watch.,3.0
"it sort of glosses over some big plot points though, which seemed a bit frustrating.",3.0
i finished watching it myself.,3.0
i expected something to surprise me at the end.,3.0
it is a little bit like the last of the mohicans or the thirteenth warrior.,3.0

he's not the greatest actor anyway.,3.0
my husband rented this.,3.0
"not too bad, has a nice twist.",3.0

i had to google the movie to read about the plot to gain some understanding.,3.0
"enjoyed it has some funny moments, but would not really recommend.",3.0
"it's a fair movie, not good, not bad.",3.0
standard fair for the murder mystery genre hollywood's fame is built on.,3.0

but the acting is still mediocre.,3.0
i was not so interested that i watched the series in several days.,3.0

the acting is pretty good and decentwriting,3.0
"it is kind of campy for us, and we do talk about them as well.",3.0
if interested in anime then this is good enough but on the ecchi side.,3.0
the villain isn't as frightening as the original largo.,3.0
i enjoyed watching it once.,3.0
"not a bad movie, the game show part of it is pretty dumb.",3.0
"not sorry i watched it, but it's just the usual teflon coated action hero stuff.",3.0

would rate it fair.,3.0

there were some moments,3.0
"i loved all the jurassics, but this one was a little disappointing.",3.0
good cast and acting but seems somewhat repetitive.,3.0

a short story that stretches for hours.,3.0
"""uneven,"" is truly the word that best comes to mind.",3.0
"after viewing the film, i was drawn to look up more about j.m.w.",3.0

"funny in places, quite cringe worthy in others.",3.0
that's why i rated it okay.,3.0
"overall, decent, but not something you'd want to see more than once or twice.",3.0
that pupil dilating element flows naturally.,3.0
i liked the more mild arnold.,3.0
toy story was awesome but it was animated so maybe that is why.,3.0
"while this information was well presented, it seemed to skim the information.",3.0
the resolution is rushed but necessary.,3.0
"however it also had cute moments and funny moments and ""awww"" moments.",3.0
ok it's hard to explain but i bet everyone has seen this movie.,3.0
i did watch the budget version of this film.,3.0
good for a rainy day watch.,3.0
i found the emphasis on sex a little disconcerting.,3.0
"my kids liked it, i thought it was rental worthy only.",3.0
it was more like an idle curiosity that left me wanting a little bit more.,3.0
i gave this movie a three star.,3.0
we all need a little tuning.,3.0
not bad not great but worth watching,3.0
was disappointed as this is not the full series.,3.0
a little too long.,3.0
"i like shows on the dvd, however the sound is kind of muddled.",3.0
just something to watch!,3.0
thought it was entertaining and like foreign films anyway,3.0
"ok,,,,,  story line seen in other movies.",3.0
i was left with wanting more.,3.0
"i liked the movie, but i have friends that did not like it.",3.0
"by adequate, i mean not inadequate and by staple, i mean not novel.",3.0
it was just ok.,3.0
not as accurate as the producers say.,3.0
the good news is that it's not completely wretched.,3.0
it was okay movie.,3.0
i however found the more recent stage performances better than this.,3.0
this is an okay video.,3.0
the story they put to the music wasn't all that great and kind of cliche.,3.0
"i'd love to see some commentary or bloopers added, too.",3.0
but the story line for this one wasn't as good.,3.0
"this is a fun movie, but it gets more vulgar than it needs to be.",3.0
it was a interesting satire nevertheless.,3.0
did have a lot of action in it.,3.0
if you don't like quentin tarantino films you might as well just move on now.,3.0
"denzel and mark w. they are funny in this movies, but not they best work.",3.0
"i won't give anything away, but not a very satisfying ending.",3.0
the ending scene was very ominous and almost frightening.,3.0
"but, is okay watching for kids if you don't mind them seeing men in drag.",3.0
"it was cute, but mindless, no real storyline.",3.0
this movie surprised me by actually being halfway decent.,3.0
"lol  story line was ok, action was good.",3.0
the best part of the movie is with the ghost of christmas present.,3.0
fun to watch with a group of people.,3.0
but the point is that it isn't a horrible movie.,3.0
but in my over analyzing mind it just fell a bit short.,3.0
this movie is ok.,3.0
i saw this movie merely because i was in the mood for an action movie.,3.0
three stars for direction and casting.,3.0
"nothing wrong with the acting, but seriously actors need something to work with.",3.0
it not rocket science but it is fun.,3.0
the adults are kinda stupid when it comes to caring for a dog.,3.0
"i liked this movie, but it had problems.",3.0
"it was not as funny as i thought it would be,",3.0
i thought it would be a little more suspesceful,3.0
this is a fairly interesting movie with a good cast.,3.0
"not really a fan of the rest of the cast, but it is worth watching.",3.0
"was ok, like john travolta",3.0
a bit of better editing might have also improved the whole piece.,3.0
"this movie probably hasn't been remastered, but the quality of the film isn't top drawer.",3.0
not sorry i bought it but it was not as good as i had hoped.,3.0
"story was just ok, but left me wanting to know more.",3.0
it's not a bad movie.,3.0
"it'snot that much, and it might just surprise you.",3.0
the movie stood on its own rather well.,3.0
he's not asking to watch it again tho.,3.0
this really could have gone places but the script was lacking.,3.0
lead actor was pretty good.,3.0
i thought it was just ok...,3.0
i wanted the series for the series' sake.,3.0
"no classic, but a decided improvement over ""spinout"" and ""kissin' cousins.""",3.0
"let me get something to read.""",3.0
"lots of action, little story.",3.0
"it was ok, alot fighting without a strong plot...",3.0
enjoyable but could have been so much better.,3.0
"good story, so so acting.",3.0
but then it sort of gets derailed.,3.0
"the movie was ok, nothing original, but at least it was somewhat entertaining.",3.0
heavy emphasis on his echo material and there were some glaring omissions from his hits.,3.0
"overall, it is a film worth watching for horror fans.",3.0
"sometimes it pushes a bit too far, though, and that's tough to look past.",3.0
the season should of wound down at the end of this season.,3.0
kind of had a hallmark movie feel to it.,3.0
"a cute movie, but too predictable.",3.0
a bit disappointing as a sequel.,3.0
i am pretty neutral toward the movie.,3.0
good but slow movie,3.0
not bad but not awesome,3.0
"worth the watch on instant play, but not really a keeper.",3.0
but it's not something i need to see again or even have in my collection.,3.0
"cute, not bad and the acting was pretty good.",3.0
i like it but just barely.,3.0
wanted this to be better.,3.0
i won't say don't watch it but i'd rent it before buying.,3.0
"but, there were a couple of plot errors.",3.0
"had some good ideas, it was an ok watch.",3.0
not enough special affects or action.,3.0
"ron is just your average, nice guy.",3.0
but i'm a gore fan and i rate this just barley ok,3.0
an ok movie when nothing better is in the offing.,3.0
and i may or may not watch it again on tv.,3.0
many of the story lines had been done during previous seasons.,3.0
it took almost the entire movie for the story to be told.,3.0
"resse witherspoon was great in this movie, it just wasn't what we were expecting.",3.0
"a bit predictable in lots of places, and a bit cheesy in others.",3.0
the acting was okay.,3.0
"however, that being said, i had expected more history behind the story i guess.",3.0
ending is pretty far fetched.,3.0
will keep you entertained but don't expect it to be wedding crashers.,3.0
"nevertheless, to award even three stars to this movie is rather charitable.",3.0
the movie had its moments.,3.0
seemed to fall apart in the later episodes.,3.0
"this is worth seeing, but really not more than once.",3.0
it wasn't awful to the point i shut it off...but i wanted more...camp or something.,3.0
but i will have to say for this one that you have to have patience.,3.0
this again was an ok movie.,3.0
the average viewer would get more suspense out of watching an episode of csi.,3.0
little scary in a cheesy way,3.0
"ok, but not one i would look to see again.",3.0
it's okay....but not an all time favorite for sure,3.0
i bought this movie for the husband and he thought it was o.k.,3.0
"it's ok at best, lots of things to nitpic but the original was better.",3.0
but there can still be good writing and good acting.,3.0
great but too short in story line.,3.0
"ok, but could have been way funnier.",3.0
had a little different twist to it.,3.0
still an ok crappy film.,3.0
some good actors headed by kevin kline.,3.0
thoe not nearly as good as its sequal game this animated flick is not bad.,3.0
was hoping for more,3.0
i only imagine how the presenters must have aged by now.,3.0
but i just couldn't give this film four or five stars.,3.0
"the bottom line was easy to follow, but much is lost in the interpretation.",3.0
entertaining movie but difficult to follow at times.,3.0
wish the lighting in the intro were better.,3.0
in fact pretty much everything is a subplot because there are so many characters.,3.0
he does come across as being relatively emotionless.,3.0
the special effects and the cinematography were pretty good.,3.0
i watched the movie all the way through and it was okay.,3.0
good enough if the movie was an hour shorter,3.0
more of a guilty pleasure but sometimes you want escapist fare.,3.0
but in the end things work out for what i'd loosely call the film's heroes...,3.0
"a friend told me it was super creepy, but i wasn't too overwhelmed with it.",3.0
an okay movie to watch but would not recommend you spend the money,3.0
average one time movie,3.0
but did deliver a good massage on the rapture,3.0
there is one thing most viewers seem to agree with.,3.0
"a little long, and definately not for young children.",3.0
i did not like it as much as the earlier season shows,3.0
probably would have been more of an experience on the big screen.,3.0
"the 'action' was well, kinda boring.",3.0
"but, got better as time went by.",3.0
story lines was predictable but cute with some good funny moments.,3.0
"it's worth watching, but will you  thinking ""man, what a stupid movie.""",3.0
"it does have a great cast though, including selma hayek and stellan skarsgrd.",3.0
"my wife and i rented this movie, and that's about all it's worth.",3.0
"i have a fascination of the caving phenomena, but ended up disappointed.",3.0
"but, towards the end, i started liking the characters.",3.0
"its ok, something to watch.",3.0
however i was disappointed by the weakmcguffin.,3.0
"as for the story...hmmm, i'm still mulling it over.",3.0
she was best as a feisty contributor to the spiffy battle scenes.,3.0
it's a bit slow for myself and my students.,3.0
"wasn't the best movie, but it wasn't horrible.",3.0
it's very bloody in parts and hard to watch at times so be warned.,3.0
"great concept, could have been better executed.",3.0
"season two was good, but showed the spark was dying in this series.",3.0
"chick flick, for sure.",3.0
haven't finished watching yet.,3.0
this is okay but look at the comparison.,3.0
"if you have read the book, the movie will seem completely different.",3.0
"raul julia does a creditable, if somewhat plodding job of portraying the archbishop.",3.0
"it was just okay, at best, a way to spend a rainy day.",3.0
"it was okay, but after seeing the one with firth, it was a big disapointment.",3.0
this movie is a more of a drama.,3.0
"cute, not raunchy, unique concept.",3.0
"like it, but was a little dragged out.",3.0
it was a kind of film noir with a modern twist.,3.0
the movie is ok.,3.0
"entertaining, yet alittle far fetched.",3.0
"just fair, decent acting.",3.0
this film is simply average.,3.0
"a little too much for me at times, but i do like the story line.",3.0
i'm giving three stars because i knew what i was getting.,3.0
it has its ups and downs.,3.0
acting was kind of melodramatic and a little over the top.,3.0
and when scully and mulder finally are together again...the spark is gone.,3.0
i wasn't that impressed with this kickboxing workout.,3.0
"i won't give it away, but the ending was not so great.",3.0
fair maybe  a liitle to long,3.0
"hoffman is great, but not what i'd call a ""historic"" performance.",3.0
the story is pretty much nothing new but it is well told.,3.0
"the story  is explained,  but never truly finished.",3.0
pretty predictable but good ending.,3.0
it's a decent movie to watch.,3.0
"it's a bit long, and drags a bit.",3.0
. . you'll have fun watching it and it's really not terribly gross.,3.0
it was ok but not the caliber of acting i'd like to see.,3.0
"okay, just not great.",3.0
i so wanted to see this movie but it was just all right.,3.0
bottom line is that this is more of a documentary than anything else.,3.0
not as funny as i expected.,3.0
it didn't feel as fluid as it could have been.,3.0
i like chris pratt but the rest of the movie needed work.,3.0
interesting and entertaining movie with a somewhat uneventful ending.,3.0
this was a okay movie to watch.,3.0
"overall, i must say it was somewhat entertaining.",3.0
the price got my attention also though  i suppose they have to make their money.,3.0
it was about two highschool students falling in love.,3.0
it is not really a tarzan movie.,3.0
it was kind of sad.,3.0
there is some amazing footage of grizzlys.,3.0
"it is not his best effort, but he portrayed the role well.",3.0
"interesting historical intrepretation, but movie was slow",3.0
"enjoyable, but not a top drawer plot.",3.0
this one is a little bit of a let down after cars.,3.0
nothing spectacular but any easy watch just to relax a bit by.,3.0
"western fans will enjoy this, as i did, but again there was just something missing.",3.0
cute story line...too much unnecessary profanity,3.0
don ameche was an improvement and there was some good dance routines included.,3.0
"but lack of exploitation aside, not bad.",3.0
"the ending was different from the book, and as such wasn't fully explained.",3.0
and everyone else thinks its ok too.,3.0
i would recommend i guess.,3.0
"interesting, but not captivating.",3.0
that isn't entirely bad.,3.0
but the story bases is still the same.,3.0
this movie on its own i could of probably enjoyed.,3.0
special effects were good.,3.0
nothing to write home about though.,3.0
"in fact i've been growing more fond of the twilight zone, it seems.",3.0
this movie is entertaining but not great.,3.0
again the plot seems to start moving forward and the challenges and threats start.,3.0
i won't look forward to the releases as much as before though.,3.0
"it was an ok movie, but not going to win any awards.",3.0
arnold is also likable although his acting range and role is limited.,3.0
if you want to study the subject further it is okay.,3.0
the picture and audio quality are fairly good but not amazing.,3.0
"my husband was more of a fan than i was, but not terrible",3.0
i would not watch it again.,3.0
it was funnier when i was a kid.,3.0
overall it was not a bad movie.,3.0
"this is fairly funny with a good cast, and not a bad story.",3.0
the plot is somewhat predictable.,3.0
the end is worth waiting for.,3.0

"although there is some things close, i have no idea where there ideas came from.",3.0
"it seemed a bit short, too.",3.0
"as for the movie, i have not watched it as yet using this product.",3.0
the movie succeeds in one shining moment but falls far short most of the time.,3.0
i found that i was interested enough to watch the whole thing.,3.0
it was boring at first then it got interesting.,3.0
worth watching but it lacks a little,3.0
the first episode did get me wanting to watch more.,3.0
the back up characters actuallycarried the film.,3.0
i'd say it's worth one watch anyway.,3.0
pretty good for an 'older' movie.,3.0
"a sign of the times, i  suppose.",3.0
"the kids are generally fun and lively, and jackie chan has some funny moments.",3.0
"an interesting story but the acting seemed a bit forced, stiff.",3.0
"anyway, as i said not too bad.",3.0
it had a great ending though.,3.0
the story could have been a lot of fun.,3.0
"nevertheless, i would have liked to see a bit of that as well.",3.0
not as good as i thought it was going to be.,3.0
it is more of a lets hold hands and sing program.,3.0
"it's not a happy one, so prepare yourself.",3.0
not the worst i've seen but not the best.,3.0
"acting was okay, not great but not horrible.",3.0
this is not the best of robert redford movies.,3.0
i did gain more knowledge of how these things happened in molokai.,3.0

this movie was entertaining but it could have been better than it is.,3.0
"the rest of the cast is solid, but a bit wasted with the spare script.",3.0

it struck me as not being as great as the hype.,3.0
dr. loomis is awesome but he doesn't really do much in this one.,3.0
decent but not great movie.,3.0
characters are at least likable.,3.0
this is a mixed bag for most fans.,3.0
"good, but not great!",3.0
one decent low budget b flick and fun.,3.0
not a bad little scifi film.,3.0
"overall, good comedy for it's time.",3.0
"otherwise, i tend to agree with those reviewers who found faults with this caper.",3.0
good acting dum movie,3.0
the animation is very decent and the premise is interesting.,3.0
basically just goes on about the sister who is in love with the brother.,3.0
"redford had an unbelievable cast, yet the movie seemed to be lacking somehow.",3.0
"it's a fun watch, just don't expect to learn anything real.",3.0
i will admit this was not as cheesy as i expected though.,3.0
"story not bad,  a little weak.",3.0
other than that it is okay!,3.0
this does seem like a cleaned up movie from what i remember.,3.0
this story would be good for young kids.,3.0
not a great flick but worth the time.,3.0
nice sit down with some popcorn night.,3.0
little more revealing than the first but not bad,3.0
it was inexpensive and you get what you pay for.,3.0
that was something new for me.,3.0
i like the original better.,3.0
this is a mediocre movie made memorable by being heath ledgers last piece of work.,3.0
"compared to ""bullitt"", released a year later, this film is kinda thin.",3.0
a few of the seasons were shrinkwraped too tight.,3.0
perhaps too big an ask as it requires improvisation and audience participation to flow.,3.0
"taken for what it is, it really isn't awful.",3.0
this dvd does have an interesting story line.,3.0
"in fact, a lot of them are fun, just repetitive.",3.0
needs to be restored.,3.0

not raw's best ppv,3.0
what a great story...unfortunately it was not developed as it could have been.,3.0
it had some interesting parts in the movie.,3.0
the film drags at times.,3.0
i'll watch it again sometimes.,3.0

"on the plus side, i thought hedda lettuce had some pretty funny lines.",3.0
this is a good way to kill a couple of hours.,3.0

like any middle chapter movie i didn't feel it as dramatically as the first.,3.0
the transfer is not perfect.,3.0

"which didn't really surprise me, given the state of the cheap plastic dividers and cases.",3.0
movie was suprisingly ok.,3.0
was just ok the original still the best as always the case .,3.0
moves a bit slow,3.0
with more time and dedication it would be better.,3.0
it's ok storywise and the animation is very good on blu ray.,3.0
but it had the same results in the lives of those involved.,3.0
it was just ok.,3.0
"for the time, the graphics are good.",3.0
the movie seemed a bit choppy.,3.0
some peopleay enjoy this but i think it lacks depth of treatment and some movement.,3.0
but wonderful actors and exquisitely detailed scenes could not compensate for a wholly unbelievable plot.,3.0
"it was ok, not great like i thought it would.",3.0
"not a total waste of time, but nothing to rave about.",3.0
this is a sweet story that suffers from overdone slapstick comedy.,3.0
i would classify more as a psychological thriller.,3.0
good actors weak atory.,3.0
"animation quality is good, but not stellar.",3.0
it seems to portray how people really lived in bible times.,3.0
"the storyline is very good, but there is nudity.",3.0

better for adults and older children.,3.0

the story moves reasonably well and the plot is plausible.,3.0
"movie is a little slow at times, not a lot to hold your interest.",3.0
and it is long.,3.0
i have to admit that the casting of owen wilson as the lead in this.,3.0
a bit of a letdown but still somewhat entertaining.,3.0
"if i had missed it, it would have been ok.",3.0
still not a bad watch.,3.0
"it's not very well directed, but it does have a few 'fun' parts.",3.0
i'm disappointed with this season so far.,3.0
decent movie but slow in places,3.0
"it is a little scary for her, but not too bad.",3.0

"perhaps if he had explained why he was taking certain steps, it would have helped.",3.0
"in this case, at least, the print of the film is good.",3.0
i felt empty when it was over.,3.0
surprising story line......was interesting to the end.,3.0

i was expecting a more compelling story.,3.0
formula piece with just enough tension and mystery to be entertaining.,3.0

it was an odd movie!!,3.0
it was good but i guess i had higher expectations.,3.0
i loved it when i was a kid but it made me kinda gloomy afterward.,3.0
"ok movie, it was a little different",3.0
his distinctive gravelly voice and performance add quality to this average sequel.,3.0
but other than that this movie isn't that different than the previous bel films.,3.0
nothing to write home about,3.0

gina is the best part of the flick.,3.0
"ok anyway, that's ok i don't care about that.",3.0

it is shorter and repeats the highlights of the latter.,3.0
it needed more story telling.,3.0
"buy the movie, but don't expect great things.",3.0
meryl streep does a fine job but anne hathaway comes across as far too meek.,3.0

"it has good action and keeps you watching, but it's not active.",3.0
not as good as i remembered growing up as a kid.,3.0

"good, but not classic chris rock.",3.0
but it is humorous..,3.0
i am not really big on comedy of this sort.,3.0
just a way for wife and me to spend some time together.,3.0
her role alone is the only reason i even decided to buy it.,3.0
"maybe that's just the thai style of film making, though...",3.0
a different kind of drug gang movie.,3.0
even an episode of 'sex and the city' merits more involvement on our part.,3.0
it would be funnier to those who are older although our twenty somethings liked it.,3.0
"he does it well, of course, but the role is no test of his skill.",3.0
i have seen better!,3.0
it was bloodier than i thought.,3.0
"a bit dry, but not bad.",3.0
i would get this it wasn't that bad i seen worst,3.0
"first half great, second a waste",3.0
"reasonable television, heavy on the social critique to keep us smiling.",3.0
i have mixed feelings about this movie.,3.0
"the quality of the video was ok, i guess...",3.0
"good acting, though, and actors you like.",3.0
"it had some good one liners, but overall, it's lacking depth.",3.0
"the idea for the story was good, but it wasn't fully developed.",3.0
i did think it was funny though!,3.0
"typical story ""michael douglas glenn close scenario",3.0
another ok disaster film.,3.0
good movie not better than the first,3.0
it was an okay movie with a twist at the end.,3.0
"plot and story line, are typical of the period.",3.0
but this film is better than s.a.t. b. ii or iii!,3.0
pretty just on the good side of ok,3.0
presentation seemed to move somewhat slowly.,3.0
maine location shots are quite beautiful.,3.0
it just isn't as well done as john landis' an american werewolf.,3.0
"in all honesty, i really didn't expect it to be what it was.",3.0
"it was ok, but i did not understand the endings.",3.0
"we love samuel l. jackson and bruce willis, but this didn't do much for them.",3.0
"all i can say is, an okay movie but certainly not great.",3.0
"this has some amusing moments, like the tour guide of james t. kirk's home town.",3.0
a good watch but some bits i would have left  out.,3.0
johnny depps role as barnabas collins was not one of his most memorable one's.,3.0
the three stars are for disturbing content.,3.0
mostly predictable but enjoyable comedy,3.0
only three stars because the movie is a bit too slow for my taste.,3.0
they throw in a little romance late in the movie.,3.0
i just think this movie had the potential to be better.,3.0
"however, it was still entertaining so not a complete waste of time.",3.0
"the imagery and animation were incredible, but i wasn't particularly sold on the story.",3.0
lots of scenes of harry's facial expressions.,3.0
"worth a look, but not if you're looking for a reason to smile!",3.0
it started out good but it became less believable as the movie progressed.,3.0
outside of that turnoff i did find the experiment of interest.,3.0
all others could probably find something else to watch that will interest them more.,3.0
i then later learned that some important scenes in many of the episodes were deleted.,3.0
left me hungry for more but all in all.... not bad.,3.0
"i think this is a great core workout, but not enough for your ames.",3.0
just an okay movie.,3.0
this is the type of movie that you view once.,3.0
would recommend for good cheap entertainment for adults.,3.0
it was an entertaining movie.,3.0
others have mentioned that the leads were probably too famous and i agree.,3.0
"not bad and not great, a few stupid moves in my opinion.",3.0
some of it is actually funny.,3.0
it's more of a slasher horror movie in the form of a western.,3.0
its a ok kind of movie,3.0
o.k but so sad,3.0
it's ok but thought there would be more action,3.0
a bit more gory than i expected.,3.0
still some good statham butt kicking but would not watch again.,3.0
the movie ended a little too abruptly for me.,3.0
so i wouldn't pay to watch it but i would say give it a go.,3.0
the storyline was okay but the acting could have been much better.,3.0
"so, it was just alright in its filming, and acting.",3.0
interesting story but not really what i was expecting.,3.0
"i must say that while the story was fairly enjoyable, it was a bit misleading.",3.0
although nothing beats a good live in person personal trainer if you can afford it.,3.0
just your average suburban neighborhood.,3.0
"that being said, it's not all that bad.",3.0
a change up from what i normally watch.,3.0
it had a couple parts but mostly was a drama.,3.0
"i rate this as ""it's okay.""",3.0
"but overall it is not a bad film, it can be very enjoyable at times.",3.0
the book is better.,3.0
has moments of high drama but somewhat contrived.,3.0
i had the feeling that the script writers were pushing to fill the time.,3.0
"the movie provides a little more dramatic spangle, as to be expected.",3.0
we enjoyed it for a while then tired of it.,3.0
i was expecting this to be more like the first one.,3.0
watch it for the fun and don't expect great filmmaking.,3.0
"the three lead guys are unlikeable, and so are the skanky girls they pick up.",3.0
i thought this wasn't a bad movie.,3.0
they would have been better using actors we had never seen before.,3.0
"it's entertaining on a superficial level, but probably rather unmemorable long term.",3.0
but something about it was a bit flat.,3.0
even at that price they are only a three star value.,3.0
this frame rate problem gets more noticeable during the action sequences.,3.0
this movie is typical of american released anime.,3.0
i was entertained enough.,3.0
as far as the storyline it was alright and the actors carried it well.,3.0
"not nearly as bad as the sequel, but not nearly as good as the original.",3.0
"ok script, a bit refreshing, a little different from the usual kids comedy.",3.0
kinda like drinking lukewarm black coffee.,3.0
the end i didn't expect.,3.0
the ending seemed to drag on and on.,3.0
its dumb but funny,3.0
it was recommended by a friend.,3.0
kinda cheezy but a good story,3.0
the preview was better than the movie.,3.0
the battle scenes were great but the characters muddled.,3.0
the background information could have been better explained.,3.0
it is okay but not one of his best.,3.0
it was ok but mostly more of the same,3.0
so far it just enough to partly keep my attention.,3.0
not for kids though...a little on the vulgar side.,3.0
not overly fond of it.,3.0
average george... funny stuff basically the same shtick,3.0
"it's not bad, but it did not suit my purposes completely.",3.0
"enjoyed it, but not one of the better marvel studio films.",3.0
overall impression is a mixture of a concert performance and early rehearsals.,3.0
the mix futuristic and this era in time not what i expected!,3.0
"entertaining, not great, but action packed.",3.0
this movie was just okay.,3.0
kind of like they forgot what made this movie so great to begin with it.,3.0
it was an ok kids movie,3.0
"you can see the ending coming a mile away, but that doesn't seem to matter.",3.0
action wins over its dialogue.,3.0
was an okay movie but not the best storyline.,3.0
decent acting and good action scenes.,3.0
nothing to write home about,3.0
the story was a little lame but entertaining to watch.,3.0
i've seen andy griffin in some funnier things.,3.0
it was not for me but my husband likes it.,3.0
that about sums up the less is more recommendation.,3.0
"see it, but don't expect the first two.",3.0
"it is worth a look, but i would not recommend buying it.",3.0
the plot was predictable but kept my attention.,3.0
the first half is great.,3.0
the acting is almost like community theater in a good way.,3.0
i might have just tired.,3.0
"entertaining, but took itself a bit too seriously.",3.0
"but since they call it ""hd"" it should fill up a modern hd tv screen.",3.0
it was better than some and not as good as alot of movies,3.0
"however, there were some funny parts.",3.0
okay for its time,3.0
it jumped around at times making it difficult to watch.,3.0
"story line was predictable but overall, the movie was ok.",3.0
free with prime it's worth watching.,3.0
could have been better though.,3.0
it's worth a look if you're a runner.,3.0
it was just okay!,3.0
so in the end the movie is solid but nothing really stands out.,3.0
i chose to give gravity a three star because of the cinematography!,3.0
"there are some great moments in the series, but parents, please preview beforehand!!",3.0
easy entertainment somewhat predictable,3.0
"other special effects were good, like when the wolves took  bits out of their victims.",3.0
i did seem to want something extra from anthony hopkins...,3.0
the first season gets a bit long in the tooth with that formula.,3.0
"they are good, but not as good as the original.",3.0
animation is ok at best.,3.0
the acting isn't as good as the first which is a shame.,3.0
keeps your interest though.,3.0
the villian's motivation could have been developed better.,3.0
"it alright,  not near as good as the original",3.0
if you just want to kill some time then watch it otherwise pick something else.,3.0
it also has a somewhat muddled plot and a hastily wrapped up cliffhanger ending.,3.0
"not as good as its trailers, but okay.",3.0
this was an ok series.,3.0
good but not as good as band of brothers.,3.0
while meryl streep and julia roberts are fantastic in this movie it kinda ended abruptly.,3.0
i kind of like that.,3.0
"the kids save the film, otherwise quite dark and unhopeful.",3.0
i think the average czech citizen would recognized a little of themselves and chuckled.,3.0
just an ok rental at best.,3.0
"sleepwalkers isn't one of sk's best movies, but it is entertaining.",3.0
"it was entertaining, not enough closure.",3.0
"but, i like wahlberg and would probably recommend it.",3.0
i give this movie three stars.,3.0
movie had some exciting scenes.,3.0
i didn't like the bad guys that much.,3.0
probably wouldn't have purchased if had looked more carefully at the content.,3.0
story evolves too slowly.,3.0
"kinda fun, but the posing becomes too distracting.",3.0
a more modern spin off of snow white with a medieval twist.,3.0
"it was ok, got a bit confusing at times, easy to guess the plotline.",3.0
"loved the music, acting was okay",3.0
this movie is filmed documentary style for the most part.,3.0

"not bad, but not as great as the first one.",3.0
"however, movie was so long, yet it really did not develop all of the characters.",3.0
"cute movie, a little slow at times kids seemed to enjoy it.",3.0
but rent it first,3.0
"the case came out good, but the disc was out of it's holder.",3.0
i would say it was worth watching for the price.,3.0
"don't expect too much if you're over the age of thirteen, though.",3.0
"it's not bad, but not something remarkable.",3.0
it was probably a stretch to try and sequel the original story.,3.0
"it features eddie murphy as dr. dolittle, reprising his original role.",3.0
there are several books that describe this.,3.0
it is worth a watch.,3.0
a decent way to relax for a couple of hours.,3.0
"however, his acting skills today would not get him to first base.",3.0
of course things have changed and nothing turned out quite like they thought.,3.0
"but, if you don't have those preconceptions, this really is a fair bit of fantasy.",3.0
expected a happier tale.,3.0
there is a story line with less typical cutting up while still maintaining their persona.,3.0
the plot to the movie is nothing special.,3.0
"it's ok, the first one was the best",3.0
not as good as some of the previous movies in this story line,3.0
not a bad movie.,3.0
the twist was nice but i'd have to watch it again to catch everything.,3.0
"first, it's long and it feels long.",3.0
"not bad, very serious.",3.0
his keys are well down in the mix.,3.0
"ok movie, kinda fun to watch, but overall just kinda meh.",3.0
"not bad, not great.",3.0
save for a little misdirection at the end.,3.0
i actaully wanted to tear up from some of the tender moments.,3.0

"it was ok., i expected mich more substance from these two accomplished actors.",3.0
"the new inspector barnaby has only one facial expression, a sort of fixed grin.",3.0

"with that said, the story was pretty decent and was creepy in some parts.",3.0
"some of the situations seem forced and contrived, but still have its' funny moments.",3.0
i guess this would be a rainy day flick.,3.0
"the performances still hold up, tho, and the premise is still cool.",3.0
it's fine for the family with mild violence and no profanities.,3.0
kids want an encore.,3.0
"a little on the chick flick side, but not too girly for most.",3.0
"however, i could not resist the sight of dwayne'rock"" johnson appearance.",3.0
"overall, not the best film, but not the worst by far.",3.0
definitely more about the drama than the dancing.,3.0
i thought it was just an okay watch.,3.0
seemed funnier when first released.,3.0
overall not the best season but it's still enjoyable.,3.0
interesting movie but not a wow movie.,3.0

"if u like this type of movie okay but,no special features",3.0
ok to rent but don't bother buying.,3.0
"about average, funny moments but without the chemistry of the lethal weapon series.",3.0

ok but not memorable.,3.0
this movie was fair and predictable.,3.0

good for a few chuckles.,3.0
